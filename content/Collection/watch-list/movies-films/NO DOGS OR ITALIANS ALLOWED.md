[Watch No Dogs or Italians Allowed (2022) on MUBI](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/no-dogs-or-italians-allowed)

## Mubi's Take

Inventive and playful, Alain Ughetto’s open-hearted marvel weaves his family’s history into a universal tale of love and endurance. Using painstaking stop-motion animation to celebrate artisanal labor of all kinds, this award-winning film attains a magical synergy between subject and form.

## My take

我很喜欢这种实拍和定格的结合。而且开头吧制作定格的过程加进去，很好的一个呼应。
