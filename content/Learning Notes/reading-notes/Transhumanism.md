# Transhumanism

在Bostrom的人看来，死亡就是恶龙。人们麻木于恶龙，而不寄希望于打倒他。对于Bostrom来说，死亡是外部的，是邪恶的。这里涉及的核心问题就是：死亡是否是我们的一部分？接受死亡的话语是人类自我安慰的麻痹剂，还是一种真正的自我和解？transhumanist 会说，一个人的死亡就是图书馆的消失，所以我们应该消灭死亡。但作者认为这样的话反过来说就不成立：这不就意味着没有对世界的知识作出贡献的人，例如智力并非超群这，甚至是有智力障的人，就死不足惜了？越是想要用功利主义证明死亡是邪恶的，越是落入功利主义的陷阱。

死亡并非我们身外之物，死亡一直存在的。我们身上总有无数的细胞死亡，只是我们以为我们活着。实际上每天的自己都死去了，新的自己又诞生了。人的意义不应只在于它能从知识生产或者劳动生产上贡献什么。一个人活着本身就是一种意义。把活着的意义和知识等同起来是危险而有偏颇的

那么现在问题就是，enhancement是道德上可以被接受的吗？这里面涉及好几个纬度的辩论。

“The hero of Bostrom’s story is the one who finally hatches a plan to slay the dragon, which represents death, and succeeds. Bostrom advocates in the parable for the moral necessity of developing anti-aging technology” ([Hall, 2017, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=24&annotation=NY47AYJT)) 在Bostrom的人看来，死亡就是恶龙。人们麻木与恶龙，而不寄希望于打倒他。

~~“For Bostrom, death is not something fundamental to life or embodiment, but rather a threat which is utterly excessive and unjust.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=25&annotation=GM2KI9X9)) 对于Bostrom来说，死亡是外部的，是邪恶的。这里涉及的核心问题就是：死亡是否是我们的一部分？接受死亡的话语是人类自我安慰的麻痹剂，还是一种真正的自我和解？~~

~~“From these perspectives, it appears that death is not a fixed part of life—life and death are detachable, and death is a foreign threat to life. Further, it seems, we can measure the value of human life by way of knowledge—individual human beings are valuable because they contribute knowledge to a global library.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=25&annotation=2WC8VG72)) 如果把一个人的死亡比做图书馆的消失，那是不是可以说，没有对世界的知识作出贡献的人，就死不足惜呢？越是想要用功利主义证明死亡是邪恶的，越是落入功利主义的陷阱。~~

~~“Yet, death seems immanent to life—cell death occurs regularly in our bodies, and indeed we die even as we live” ([Hall, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=25&annotation=HSBIH9JB)) 然而死亡说一直存在的。我们身上总有无数的细胞死亡，只是我们以为我们活着。实际上每天的自己都死去了，新的自己又诞生了。~~

~~“the view that knowledge production is the reason human lives are valuable, or even the primary reason human lives are valuable, is at best a partial and misleading picture and, at worst, dangerous and deadly for those excluded. If one concedes that knowledge is what makes life valuable, this implies that persons whose knowledge is discounted or disqualified—people with intellectual disabilities, along with other vulnerable people around the globe—do not have lives worth living. Contesting this caricature of human life is part of the project of this book” ([Hall, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=25&annotation=I6B6IMUQ)) 人的意义不应只在于它能从知识生产或者劳动生产上贡献什么。一个人活着本身就是一种意义。把活着的意义和知识等同起来是危险而有偏颇的~~

~~“One cannot assume that enhancement is morally acceptable without, in effect, refusing to enter the debate before it begins” ([Hall, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=26&annotation=TCNU67HN))~~

“how can enhancement be morally evaluated?” ([Hall, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=26&annotation=6JBJI3DZ))

“Some philosophers use these two distinctions, between the authentic and the unauthentic and between therapy and enhancement, to maintain that only authentic or therapeutic enhancements are morally acceptable, thereby taking much of what proponents of enhancement mean when they use the word “enhancement” off the table. Others, like Harris, forego these distinctions to argue that all enhancements—globally—are not only morally acceptable but also morally obligatory” ([Hall, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=26&annotation=FVBJ4LTT)) 如果只有是否authentic，是否是therapeutic来衡量是站不住脚的，

“The moral motive for using technology to intervene in the natural lottery of life is for the sake of the goods that this will bring about . . . equality of opportunity may sometimes be one of these goods . . . saving lives or what is the same thing, postponing death, removing or preventing disability or disease or enhancing human functioning are the more obvious and usually the more pressing reasons. (2011, 147) This passage conflates “removing or preventing disability or disease” and “enhancing human functioning.” In practice, the distinction between positive and negative eugenics is just as misleading as other common divides. The commonplace view that disability is to be avoided, and to enhance means much the same thing as avoiding disability, means that a disability analysis of enhancement issues is necessary” ([Hall, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=27&annotation=X69K7CTT)) 把提高和优生等同，等于把disability直接等同于需要被消灭的东西

“If we focus on enhancement’s goals, rather than slippery distinctions, we can critically assess enhancement and avoid begging the moral question of enhancement (i.e. assuming that enhancement is good, full stop). The burden in the debate is thus shifted back to proponents of enhancement, who—as we shall discover—weave fantasies of health, ability, and the good life that are troublesome and exclusionary” ([Hall, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=27&annotation=NB7AL522)) 我们也需要从动机上去观察这种叙事——到底是谁在铸造关于健康、能力和更好的生活的神话

“it is worth noting that some more moderate philosophers play it too safe with regard to enhancement. They make proposals with which no one would disagree, such as being sure any proposed enhancement is accessible and effective and that harm to individuals is to be avoided at all costs. These qualifications do not get us any clearer on the special issues presented by the ethical question of enhancement—indeed, they sound like prescriptions for action for any public policy development, and they are subject to the same roadblocks” ([Hall, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=28&annotation=IFQTAH5G)) 只是说这些设施是免费的，fully accessible的，并不会变成一个免死金牌。它只是逃避了关于enhancement很本质的问题，而且是一个过于理想化的想象。

“Bioethicists discuss everything from the body-contouring effects of liposuction to scientific research aimed at discovering ways to counteract the aging process in cells. But, emerging technologies, including genetic screening and editing procedures such as CRISPR, capture center stage.2 Nootropic drugs (cognitive enhancers like modafinil), also receive high levels of attention (Battleday and Brem 2015). So, what is uniquely at stake in contemporary discussions is the acceptability of heritable medical interventions, with special attention to the mind” ([Hall, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=28&annotation=BRZETM9R)) 现代医学的很多技术都是用来对抗细胞和身体的老化和dysfunction的，但是最核心的辩论是在那些可以被遗传的改造上，例如CRISPR技术。

“those who are pro-enhancement. This group is typically referred to as “bio-libertarian” and overlaps significantly with thinkers who consider themselves transhumanists, or at least fellow travelers. Bio-conservatives and bio-libertarians are treated, by those both inside and outside of the debate, as if they were in deep disagreement” ([Hall, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=28&annotation=6LRV6JNC))

“Ramsey worried that we sought to produce a man-God hybrid by genetic means who would destroy “the sanctity of the individual” (146).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=29&annotation=QB8YYNDZ)) 保守派的重要思想来源于一些神学的部分——我们是否会造出一个新的神出来

“thinkers like Jürgen Habermas and Michael Sandel enjoin us to protect the boundaries of human nature, along with human dignity, from interference and temptation. Tied to this are Sandel’s appeals, which echo Kass’s work, to human wisdom and appropriate humility. Resonating among bio-conservatives is a commonplace claim originally made by Ramsey: “Men ought not to play God before they learn to be men, and after they have learned to be men they will not play God” (1970, 137” ([Hall, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=29&annotation=MAYJ8FGR))

“The “playing God” objection is curious because it assumes that technology can give us such total control that we might as well call ourselves God. This is chimerical. But, more curious still is the fact that transhumanists also embrace a portrait of technology that implies God-like control, a move which mystifies and elevates technology (Bostrom 2003)” ([Hall, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=29&annotation=T7AHYZXZ)) 保守派和激进派都同意这种“科技造神”的想象

“Outsized belief in the power of technology over human life, as if it were a foreign invader, is shared by proponents and opponents of enhancement technologies alike” ([Hall, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=29&annotation=SFPVWAB6))

“Beyond the mystification and elevation of technology to a God-like role, otherwise-opposed bioethicists agree on the importance of authenticity, the uniqueness of human beings, and the importance of equal opportunity. This overlap is significant.3” ([Hall, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=29&annotation=2GVBGL9V)) 实际上保守派和激进派都会强调平等和人类的独特性，但是他们一个是靠拒绝改造实现，一个是靠人人都改造来实现。

“First, authenticity;” ([Hall, 2017, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=29&annotation=R4TJYRCG))

“Thinking back to Bostrom’s parable, consider that he poses death as an obstacle to loving human relationships. Death is an interruption which dissolves communities—so enhancement strategies which subvert death can enhance human communities and our authentic selves in turn” ([Hall, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=30&annotation=TX7MNBEW))

“Second, both sides of the debate claim that the human being is uniquely placed among the things in the natural world.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=30&annotation=YMZQQ5LG))

“Yet Bostrom and transhumanist Anders Sandberg argue that paying attention to human wisdom (as the bio-conservative desires) requires taking enhancement seriously because humans are uniquely situated to draw lessons from history and evolution (Bostrom 2004; Bostrom and Sandberg 2011).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=30&annotation=C8TDA6DG))

“Another touchstone in this debate is equality of opportunity, which is called upon to both justify and object to interventionist medical and technological enhancement strategies.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=30&annotation=8MPK3BNP))

“They claim that the arena of justice is, in effect, a phenomenon of slow “colonization” of circumstances once left to chance (82–84). On this view, intervention is only ethically justified when we have control over (have colonized) circumstances, but that realm grows along with new technologies and scientific understanding. This is a technological imperative. That is, as technology becomes available that can be used to intervene upon the human body, one should use it. Buchanan et al. justify this imperative via the concept of equal opportunity” ([Hall, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=30&annotation=RYW4VIGZ))

“Peter Singer invokes equal opportunity to discuss possible negative effects of enhancement, specifically genetic interventions. He claims that genetic intervention would work against equal opportunity unless it is regulated (2011). This is because of its potential, in a global marketplace, to be used only by already-advantaged persons with ready access to wealth” ([Hall, 2017, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=31&annotation=AD7VKN84)) 一开始有钱的人自然是更容易获得这些access，就像万神殿里最开始能获得上传的都是富家子弟。

“some have argued that cloning is an affront to human dignity, because it inhibits a kind of right to be an individual. But, arguments of this kind elevate the importance of replicated DNA material to the level of identity.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=31&annotation=F3CUXTDL)) DNA不等同于一个人的identity，但这个事情在Caspian 和Stephen的关系中就很有意思。Caspian虽然是Stephen的克隆，但是他的人生却和Stephen大相径庭。

“argue that cloning is a technological innovation of key importance for future change engages the body as a site of political problemsolving” ([Hall, 2017, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=31&annotation=UN3V94CK)) 把所有问题的希望寄托在克隆身上，似乎也是把身体看作一个可以轻松解决政治问题解决的场域。

“advocates of the use of cloning technology strictly separate reproduction via cloning from typical reproduction, which also signals a kind of misunderstanding—reproduction, as Derrida contends, is always a matter of repetition, and cloning will always involve novel elements (146–148).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=31&annotation=HNPKZRBX)) 生育包含复制，而克隆也往往包含新生。

([Hall, 2017, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) 在克隆的讨论中基因决定论是兵家必争之地，也是很多对于克隆的反对者会提出的质疑。主要的分论点是以下几点：  
1\. 基因改造会限制人类的自由  
2\. 孩子不再是礼物而是产品  
3\. 才能和天赋不再是他本人应得的  
4\. 克隆人的独特性是被侵犯的  
然而上面的每一条都是对基因作用的夸大。

“This is because making public policy recommendations that would dedicate a vast sum of funds to create genetic enhancement technologies and make them available to the public at least approaches what Mianna Lotz refers to as “geneticism”—the privileging of genetic causes over other factors—if not a stronger variety of genetic determinism” ([Hall, 2017, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=32&annotation=8L8XQP2M)) 向政府提议把经费花在基因技术上，不管是多mild的建议，也是一种对基因决定论的支持。毕竟有这钱，为啥不花在基础建设上面？

“Genetic determinism has two inflections. The first reads as follows: if a trait is identified as genetically or biologically determined, it is unchangeable (or opportunities to alleviate it are significantly limited), and responsibility for the issue falls to the individual rather than political or social institutions (Haslam 2011, 819; Lewontin 1992, 23, 36–37; Nelkin and Lindee 1995, 16, 18, 93). Consider the case of allergies or genetic predispositions to certain sensitivities that would rule out a person working in certain environments. Rather than ensuring safe working conditions in a workplace, the employer has recourse to require a person to disclose any sensitivities and then can declare the worker not fit for the workplace (as opposed to the workplace being unfit for workers) (Nelkin and Lindee 1995, 161).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=32&annotation=3RKHRZYB)) 基因决定论会首先认为基因是固化的，并在这个基础上认为个人的特质无法符合社会工厂的规范也是个人的原因，而非工作环境应该提供的合理便利。

“The second inflection suggests that if a trait is genetically determined it is changeable, but only through technology or genetic interventions (Nelkin and Lindee 1995, 101). In a genetic reduction, a genetic problem requires a genetic or technological—rather than a social or political—solution.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=32&annotation=GTD5NDY4)) 基因决定论如果认为基因可以被后天改变，那么改变的手段也往往不是社会或者人为的认知，而是得通过科技手段。

“Transhumanists who work in the genetic mode render the body, taken as a bundle of genes, the primary site of human (and therefore, social and political) improvement while at the same time taking for granted that technological interventions on the body, especially genetic interventions, have the power to “enhance” (as Singer does, above). This disregards political and social responsibility for quality of life.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=33&annotation=2XNEFXD5)) 过分依赖于科技来enhance人类，忽略了政治和社会对于提高人类生活质量的责任。  
毕竟科技的口号永远是： make the world a better place. 科技的这种中立属性以及它立竿见影的便利程度，可以让人忘却它背后的成本和代价。它干净的外壳和机械的构成背后的权力结构和劳工关系是可以被忽略的。

“diametrically opposed positions in bioethical debates over enhancement actually share fundamental presuppositions.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=33&annotation=AMMZZPGH)) 保守派和激进派虽然看上去水火不容，但是实际上他们共享很多本质的前提，例如基因决定论、例如科技造神论等。大家忙于争吵这些前提下的延伸，却没有人质疑这些大前提是否是伪命题。

“Take the pressure to be tall and deliberation regarding the use and distribution of the human growth hormone to the end of tallness (see Daniel Brock and Eric Juengst in Parens 1998; Buchanan et al. 2000, 115–119). The example is usually posed as a problem among young boys. Use of this example to discuss possible enhancements obfuscates and trivializes the bodily stigma and pressure to conform felt by those whose bodies have been raced, sexed, and disabled.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=33&annotation=NTMMJ4WN)) 不能简单地把身高和残障的问题做一个类比，因为这是在把残障和种族的体验trivialized成身高这样的面子问题。残障人和种族是在面对很现实的生存问题和系统性经济压迫。

“the motive to enhance is often characterized by many male bioethicists as an issue of competition, which is already obvious from worries over fair play” ([Hall, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=33&annotation=S94NXN6Y)) enhancement的问题也不仅仅是关于竞争的问题。

“What future do transhumanists hope to bring about through enhancement technologies?” ([Hall, 2017, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=33&annotation=PDGCUBLI))

“Instead of turning away from technology or indulging in “technophobia,” (the mistake of bio-luddites) transhumanists believe that new technologies in the fields of genetics, robotics, information, and nanotechnology—should be welcomed as potentially improving human life, although they are risky (ibid., see also Garreau 2005, 115; Rubin 2008, 137).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=2JBDJT98)) 这是transhumanist的理念——拥抱技术作为一种可以重新定义和设计人类的工具。

“Transhumanist promote the investment of time and research into technology to improve cognition, anti-aging techniques, reproductive technology, and life suspension techniques such as cryogenics—all of which are cited by the Declaration—in order to understand both their risks and possibilities. Ultimately, what individuals stand to gain, according to transhumanists, is the “use of technology to extend their mental and physical (including reproductive) capacities and to improve their control over their own lives” (Bostrom 2005b, Appendix). In sum, the Declaration claims that transhumanists “seek personal growth beyond our current biological limitations”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=E8E6SJXV)) Transhumanist的定义——他们都做些什么。

“Bostrom argues that science should be used to “achieve mastery over nature in order to improve the living conditions of human beings” (ibid., see also Rubin 2008, 137). In short, “rational humanism” is where transhumanism locates its heritage, adding only that the human is among those objects of nature to be conquered” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=PQRBPQIS)) Bostrom是transhumanism的代表人物，他有一种要征服自然的态度。

“the reshaping of the human being would be directed toward improvement in terms of capabilities,” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=Q7NQ6QFF)) transhumanism会着眼于最大化“可能性”和“能力范围”。capability不只是ability，还是capable，也就是你有资格可以做这个事情。

“Transhumanism’s hoped-for, reshaped human being is often referred to as the posthuman.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=W9BG2TVQ)) 原来transhumanism的终极对象就是posthuman！我醉了！突然觉得后人类很有问题啊怎么那么多艺术家在搞后人类捏！美其名曰去人类中心主义，但transhumanism难道不是最人类中心的事情吗？

“Posthumans could be completely synthetic artificial intelligences, or they could be enhanced uploads . . . or they could be the result of making many smaller but cumulatively profound augmentations to a biological human” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=9DJ3W8S6)) 天呐，所以万神殿处理的其实就是后人类的事情。所有的UI都是后人类，AI也可以是后人类，CI也是后人类。

“To be posthuman, according to transhumanists, is to inhabit a state generally considered not only a departure from what are commonly considered human qualities but also radically better than, or transcendent of, humanity as we know it” ([Hall, 2017, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=34&annotation=6UF74LZG)) 成为后人类，基本上可以说是摒弃人类的身体。

“One may thus argue, along with Donna Haraway, that we are already posthuman. But, here I am concerned with investigating the transhumanist promotion of a specific, hoped-for, future posthuman, believed by transhumanists to be so increased in capacities that it would be difficult to assign the word “human” to this being.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=35&annotation=I5JC9Y6L)) 并不是后人类就是绝对的需要地址的，而是一种统一化的想象是贫瘠而危险的。

“There are a variety of senses of posthumanism. Transhumanism’s sense of the posthuman is not the only contemporary meaning of the term, and distinguishing among various meanings of posthumanism will help illuminate transhumanism’s usage.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=35&annotation=DJQQUZG7)) 哦，所以其实后人类不等同于transhuman，但是transhuman是后人类的一种。

“Transhumanism’s posthuman is not equivalent, for instance, to the concept of posthuman used in critical animal studies to challenge philosophical investments in or the moral relevance of traditional species boundaries.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=35&annotation=RRBE8F37))

“Wolfe draws this line precisely because he recognizes the humanism that Bostrom identifies as the “roots” of transhumanism, a sense of “posthumanism [that] derives directly from ideals of human perfectibility, rationality, and agency” (Wolfe 2009, xiii). Wolfe uses his own posthumanist critique to target these ideals, and to show that the positive “aspirations” of humanism are “undercut by the philosophical and ethical frameworks used to conceptualise them” (xvi). Among these aspirations are better treatment of nonhuman animals and persons with disabilities that the confining “normative subjectivity” of humanism prevents (xvi–xvii). Wolfe compares posthumanism to transhumanism in this way: “posthumanism in my sense isn’t posthuman at all—in the sense of being ‘after’ our embodiment has been transcended—but is only posthumanist, in the sense that it opposes the fantasies of disembodiment and autonomy, inherited from humanism itself . . .” (xv). In contrast, Bostrom’s vision of the posthuman is a realization of the fantasies of disembodiment and autonomy and so supports, rather than questions, normative subjectivity.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=35&annotation=X3PC97I4)) 对于Wolfe来说，后人类并不是关于摒弃肉身。他更相信“后人文”主义，也就是摒弃人类中心的视点。这样看来，transhumanism和posthuman其实是大相径庭的。一个是对于人类中文和去具身的高度实现，并且reinforce某种主流话语；另一个则是拥抱不同的生物和种族，拥抱多样性和去中心的叙事。

“the soul is the “prison of the body” (Foucault 1979, 30).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=36&annotation=5WYGTVNU))

“Foucault theorized that evolving concepts of the human structure acceptance and rejection of particular bodies, and contribute to suspect normalization practices. Meanwhile, transhumanist thinking serves to further buttress notions of abnormality that are in turn used to exclude certain bodies from political and social privileges” ([Hall, 2017, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=36&annotation=VVYB4TJN)) transhumanism与福科背道而驰

“transhumanism is not identical with the ironic cyborg utopia first imagined by Donna Haraway in 1985” ([Hall, 2017, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=36&annotation=VSH8Z5D6))

“Wolfe identifies Haraway’s legacy as the “cyborg” strand of posthumanism and claims that although transhumanism takes cues from her work, it does not much resemble the spirit of Haraway’s attempted intervention (2009, xiii). Transhumanism looks forward to a time when posthumans arrive, but Haraway’s work argues that distinctions which uphold the figure of the human as autonomous, whole, and rational are already broken down and inapplicable.4” ([Hall, 2017, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=36&annotation=4W7D5X7G)) donna haraway想象的后人类和transhumanism想象的后人类不一样，trans humanist, imagine post human as a God to come, like Stephen Holstrom, yet Harraway believes that this kind of distinction between Posthuman and human has already been dissolved.

“He lays out the case for posthumanism in the transhumanist sense of having “vastly greater capacities than present human beings have,” and marks nature as a work-in-progress (619). He denies that transhumanism entails technological optimism; he takes risk seriously and knows that technology can be misused. Bostrom has referred to this kind of optimism as the “Panglossian view,” which he uses to refer to the mistaken idea that progress will reliably continue apace as it has in the past (2004” ([Hall, 2017, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=36&annotation=IQF9T439)) Although Bol Strom believes that post human is going to be much more powerful than us, he does not acknowledge the trans humanism is technological optimism.

“He desires the ability to protect ourselves from disease, shape our bodies freely, and the freedom offered by copying a version of our brain in silicon (621).6” ([Hall, 2017, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=37&annotation=7DZCUEZP))

“With regard to mood and energy, he cites the widely held view that “we often fail to feel as happy as we like” (ibid.). The fact that we do not always feel the best possible sensations, or feel as happy as we are in our best moments, is a problem for Bostrom on par with existential risk and death. Unfortunately, most of us are not good at recognizing these issues as problems (2005d). Finally, he claims that we have limited willpower to break habits (2009, 622).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=37&annotation=9NHU38G3))

“For him, we can begin to value posthuman existence even from a limited capacity to understand it and on the basis of currently held values (ibid.). This implies that we need not choose the posthuman over human life, but some of our ideals are currently not accessible to us. Therefore, transhumanism, in its pursuit of the posthuman, would allow us to “explore hitherto inaccessible realms of value” (623)” ([Hall, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=38&annotation=6JTFAI8Z)) 后人类代表一种未知的mw hc

“in order to engage technological means to explore the posthuman realm, he sets out several objectives for policy that he sees as “basic conditions” for transhumanist goals (ibid.). These include, as a non-negotiable requirement, global security, including the avoidance of existential risk.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=38&annotation=TWMSKMKI))

“he believes it would be “sub-optimal” if wide access to exploration of the posthuman were not possible.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=38&annotation=ICA4YDIM)) 这措辞真是笑死我了sub-optimal!

“For him, limitations to bodily modification based on another person’s disgust “would not normally be a legitimate ground for coercive interference,” and “centrally planned efforts” for making better people are wrong (2009, 624). We should promote democracy the world over in order to aid in responsible decision-making with regard to technology. We cannot rely on “our old habits and beliefs” to make “wise choices” and should further take advantage of the insights of artificial intelligence as it surpasses human intelligence (ibid.). Additionally, transhumanists value the well-being of all sentient life, which deserves our consideration as we pursue posthumanism (a concern that becomes all the more urgent, Bostrom implies, if we are successful). Finally, Bostrom emphasizes that we must save lives, as that is of primary moral value; this includes working against involuntary death and aging. For him, as we learned at the outset of this chapter, antiaging medicine is of primary importance and cryonic suspension should be made available (ibid.)” ([Hall, 2017, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=38&annotation=AJLAN24B)) 很有趣。Bostrom就像一个满口仁义道德的大反派。虽然他们做的事情无疑会将世界推入一更更加卷的漩涡，但是他仍然会高喊民主自由的口号，倡导不要依赖旧有的习惯。but the old habit he is talking about is probably

“ultimately, Bostrom does not believe that these bad outcomes will come about as a result of the transhumanist pursuit of posthumanity: such dystopian scenarios are speculations. There is no firm ground for believing that the alleged consequences would actually happen. What relevant evidence we have, for instance regarding the treatment of children who have been conceived through the use of in vitro fertilization or embryo screening, suggests that the pessimistic prognosis is alarmist. Parents will in fact love and respect their children even when artificial means and conscious choice play a part in procreation. (2012, 108–109)” ([Hall, 2017, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=39&annotation=83MZDVZY)) 感觉这个老哥对人性有一种异常的乐观……真的不怪保守派有点alarmist，因为人真的什么都可以赶出来的啊！

“He further claims that it is possible that parents will find it easier to love children who are happy and healthy, and people with disabilities will be better off. For him, good consequences and bad are both possible, but the “potential gains are enormous . . . healthier, wittier, happier people may be able to reach new levels culturally”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=39&annotation=SLVLFMZG)) 虽然这个老哥嘴上说得好听，但是实际上他还是想着人种清洗那一套！只要健全健康就会快乐，残障人可以顺便收益。实际上他还是有一套内在的“什么样的人生是更加值得过的”。

“He acknowledges, however, that the libertarian approach has drawbacks; specifically, children have important interests that must be considered. But, current measures to protect children can be extended to deal with genetic enhancement technologies and other emerging technologies. He focuses again on risk and opportunities, arguing that “we ought to outlaw genetic modifications that are intended to damage the child or limit its opportunities in life, or that are judged to be too risky” (ibid.)” ([Hall, 2017, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=39&annotation=MNIMUWLX)) 如果说他认为会限制孩子成长的modification就是糟糕的话，那他一定会觉得想要聋人小孩的父母是不可饶恕的。

“Bostrom does not want to encourage positional advantage enhancements (like height).7 Encouraged enhancements should have both significant intrinsic benefits and positive social externalities (like health) (111). Most cases are mixed, like memory and intellect, and in these cases we should weigh the externalities. If the positive externalities are high, we should encourage and subsidize this type of enhancement (depending on the political climate” ([Hall, 2017, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=39&annotation=V6AU83ZF)) 老哥的愿景很理想，但是事实上人类的欲望就是会不断滑坡的吧。人会希望更多更好，要更强的记忆里，更聪明，更高更快更强……基础总是在一步步拔高的，看看中国的教育就可以看得出来了，以前的孩子多好养活啊。

“Bostrom is thinking of cases in which inequalities are based on merit, have social benefit, or are the result of foolish decision-making (112). Bad inequality can meanwhile be counteracted with social policies like subsidies or free services; we might also consider mandating net-positive genetic enhancements that would counteract the inequality that arises from free choice (113). But, this may not be necessary; it is very possible that instead of increasing inequality, “the lot of the genetically worst-off is radically improved”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=40&annotation=Y8F9FI95)) what's genetically worst-off? disability吗

“Overall, Bostrom believes a future of increased happiness is possible if only we were to invest in enhancement technologies—not only a future of new pleasure, but also an increasingly moral and politically just future (Bostrom 2008).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=40&annotation=5TI64VIC))

“It seems that for transhumanists, only two reactions to technology—that is, passivity and activity—are possible. They trade in one false dilemma, that between techno-optimism and techno-pessimism, for another” ([Hall, 2017, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=41&annotation=RRI2G4H9))

“Passivity represents ignoring possible control over one’s future. From this perspective, it seems that being subject to chance is anti-human (insofar as to be human is to engage proactively with change), anti-happiness, and anti-progressive.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=41&annotation=WS25CJ2D))

“characterizing worries about radical enhancement as a refusal to alleviate suffering closes off conversation prematurely; there are, as we shall see, good reasons to worry about enhancement strategies that do not involve the rejection of emerging technologies as such and have little to do with charges of bioconservatism.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=41&annotation=K8KGV5YI)) 担心科技不代表就要放弃科技。这不是一个用与不用的问题，而是一个态度问题和侧重点问题。是一个叙事的问题——毕竟bio conservative和bio activist实际上是就同一个故事的前提讲出了不同的故事。

“those marked as disabled are subject to systematic exclusions on the basis of that marking, not on the basis of fundamental features of their biology that can be overcome via technology” ([Hall, 2017, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=52&annotation=AUZGJGDW))

“While disability communities are sometimes treated as political minorities, like other groups that have sought civil rights and equal treatment, it is important to avoid the ways that a pervasive “minority model” might contribute to the marginalization of persons with disabilities and positions them as a competing group that participates in policing the border between disability and ability” ([Hall, 2017, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=52&annotation=T35E5SCV)) 虽然残障人是也是一个政治群体，但是不能把它们和所有的少数群体政治混为一谈

“Power, then, is not a simple matter of a dyadic relationship between two persons, A and B, in which A is powerful and B, because she is influenced by A, experiences domination. For Foucault, power is a matter of networks of subjects and objects, is non-agential, and has both “negative” (what one might call constraining) and “positive” effects (what one might call self-expression). We build and engage our subjectivity in and through power. Specifically, as I have argued, bioethics discourse is embedded in a power regime that Foucault refers to as biopolitical” ([Hall, 2017, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=53&annotation=QWVPVVL8)) 权力不只是一个人比另一个人强——它是一张网。权力对每个人都有限制，也有提供自我表达的空间。作者的论述和福柯的权力意志很有关系。

“If we follow Foucault’s shift to discourses and institutions, we can begin to understand how people are regulated, disciplined, and produced by social forces” ([Hall, 2017, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=53&annotation=H3DXM766)) 沿着福科的关于话语和机构的讨论，我们就能发现人的身份是如何被一点一点塑造出来的

“Public executions are an early political technology, now superseded. In contrast, through surveillance—a key ingredient of biopower—everyone is given a place. All subjects are conditioned as either normal or abnormal, and slotted into various fractured spaces, including hospitals, prisons, nursing homes, and in exile.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=54&annotation=38F9U5EH))

“Psychiatric experts are asked to be witnesses with regard to the criminal’s tendencies, providing a criminal prehistory in which characteristics are naturalized and made punishable: “After all, if he has stolen, it is basically because he is a thief” (2003a, 16).1 In this way, the abnormal subject takes root.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=54&annotation=87WYGMUV)) 精神病专家在法庭里的职责感觉有点竖靶子射击的感觉。为了能够定罪找出ta人格里可以被定罪的事情。

“Disability is historically, materially, and discursively connected to the idea of abnormality, and the idea of the disabled subject—which individual persons engage and reject, build upon and critique—is produced, not born.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=54&annotation=272ADD4E))

“Davis argues that harm results when disabilities are genetically chosen by parents; specifically, a future harm of narrowed possibilities, a closing-off of the so-called right to an open future (2010, 59–60; 1997, 14). But, she also seems to peg harm as an endemic element of her definition of disability, especially when she talks about her primary case study: deafness. For instance, as a response to the Deaf community’s self-identification as a cultural minority, Davis writes: “On the other side of the argument is the evidence that deafness is a very serious disability. Deaf people have incomes thirty to forty percent below the national average. The state of education for the deaf is unacceptable by anyone’s standards; the typical deaf student graduates from high school unable to read a newspaper” (1997, 12–13). But, how are these statistics evidence of disability?” ([Hall, 2017, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=55&annotation=UZEP6Z5T)) Dena Davis认为选择让孩子出生为残疾是不道德的，因为残疾就是残疾，残疾人穷、受教育程度不高。然而，这不是某种因果倒置吗？就是首先因为残障被歧视，被歧视到要从出生开始就被抹杀，所以才有着一系列的问题啊。用这一系列的现象反过来谴责受害者，这并不是一个合理的解释。

“the low-income status or imprisonment rates of racial and ethnic minorities—these numbers are evidence of prejudice, not direct results of features such as the color of one’s skin, one’s lineage, or one’s birthplace.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=55&annotation=4VGHDIRR)) 虽然很多低收入群体入狱程度很高，但这只是偏见的佐证，不能证明低收入“代表”这些特质。

“Davis is opposing “cultural minority” with “disability”—she assumes that the two concepts cannot overlap, without interrogating them.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=55&annotation=AXCNE2IF))

““Ethically, we would certainly include destroying someone’s hearing as being a ‘harm’; legally, one would undoubtedly receive compensation if one were rendered deaf due to someone else’s negligence. Many deaf people, however, have recently been arguing that deafness is not a disability at all, but a linguistic and cultural identity” (2010, 65, emphasis mine, cf. Lane 2010). So, if deafness is not a disability for the Deaf community, Davis seems to be saying, they would not consider it harmfultherefore, disability and harm are employed here as one and the same thing.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=55&annotation=BE3JKHJN)) Davis有很奇怪的推论——因为我们普通人认为致人耳聋是一种伤害，而聋人的观念冲击了伤害的定义，所以他们是有问题的。但这似乎就是在为了强行维持一种normality对于伤害的定义，一种“正常人”的权威。

“Here, Davis opposes the concepts of “oppressed minority” and “disabled group” as if it were impossible for one collective to be both at the same time. This is another slippage: if Davis believes these two ways of describing a group are mutually exclusive, she fails to make her reasons explicit.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=56&annotation=EYCK38EH)) Dena认为一个群体要么得是disabled group，要么得是oppressed minority, 然而难道diabled group 和oppressed minority吗？

“it is important to note that Davis is correct when she asserts that “many deaf people, however, have recently been arguing that deafness is a not a disability at all, but a linguistic and cultural identity” (2010, 65). In other words, at least some deaf persons, who identify as part of the Deaf community, reject the label of disability. The questions we are left with include: what is disability? Is it embodied “harm?” Does it make protest impossible? If disability culture exists, does that make it necessary to shed the label of “disability,” as some in the Deaf community and Davis seem to believe? Why does identifying as “disabled” seem to eclipse and delimit other identities which a person might take up?” ([Hall, 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=56&annotation=GZ5DKHYH)) 确实有很多聋人不认为自己是disability，那么当我们从这一个群体推广到其他的残障群体的时候，问题就来了：是不是其他的残障群体也应该摒弃这种“伤残”的label？摒弃这一层含义对残障群体的反抗是有益的吗？  
我其实觉得残障作为一个有这么多spectrum的群体，也很难一概而论的。因为慢性病、长期疼痛也是残障的诱因一种，着不是一种每个人都可以笑着说这不是事儿的事情。

“For many in the disability rights community, “discrimination results when people in one group fail to imagine that people in some ‘other’ group lead lives as rich and complex as their own”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=56&annotation=GAUI4CMX)) 当你觉得其他的群体没有像你一样“丰富而美满”的生活的时候，你就在认为他们是disability了

“William J. Peace has argued that the current euthanasia debate, which tends to assume that death is preferable to living a life with disability, expresses this failure of the imagination (2012). Surely, however, as Peace also argues, dismal institutional failures and a lack of social responsiveness are also to blame and can be the ultimate sources for imaginative failures” ([Hall, 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=56&annotation=AQ3AJF7K)) 人们认为如果残疾了可能生不如死，体现了人们对于其他人生活想象的贫瘠，“令人沮丧的制度失灵和缺乏社会响应能力也是罪魁祸首，可能是想象力失灵 的最终根源”。  
当人们对于社会的改变失去信心，同时当一个人的生活被其他人的标准所左右，人

“illness and limitations connected to disabilities makes politically ironic “reversal” moves open to other groups, like people of color, much harder to accomplish. Disability theorist Irving Zola writes of the problem: “Could [disability activists] yell, ‘Long live cancer’ ‘Up with multiple sclerosis’ ‘I’m glad I had polio!’ ‘Don’t you wish you were blind?’”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=56&annotation=YRK586EI)) 因为残障和疾病深深地挂钩，而疾病是一个不可逆转的否定形象，所以这就让残障权益运动举步维艰。

“A person may be integrated with family or friends who may not and likely do not share their disability, and so, writes Zola, “they are socialized into the world of the ‘normal’ with all its values, prejudices and vocabulary” (1993, 167). This particular kind of isolation is largely unique to the case of disability” ([Hall, 2017, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=56&annotation=KDNQISYG)) 因为残障人很有可能在一个完全废残障的，健全主义主导的社会里成长起来，ta的思维也完全有可能是一种健全主义的思维。这是一种isolation， 这种isolation让残障人的团结变得困难，因为即便有的残障人会呼吁团结，但是其他残障人可能思维依旧是健全主义思维的。

“Further, isolation goes beyond these issues to systematized social practices of isolation like “special” (usually segregated) education, warehousing in nursing homes (even for children), and sheltered workshops which are legally permitted to pay persons with disabilities subminimum wage.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=57&annotation=8VKP2RLT)) 特殊教育、儿童特殊教育和庇护工场也是在一种慈善和法制的情况下给残障人比较低的待遇了。

“The very act of creating or discursively supporting spectrums and taxonomies shapes the contours of disability, creating gradations of stigma and a variety of political and social responses.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=57&annotation=J4MHMIGU)) 如果说只是把残障简单地归因于生理因素，那么很多东西都可以逐渐归为残障

“Paralysis of the legs (perhaps resulting from polio or spina bifida) is the impairment; the inability to walk is the disability; but it is “the social consequences of that disability—the refusal of employers to hire a disabled person” ([Hall, 2017, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=57&annotation=U5BYPZAV))

“Taking the social model’s interpretation of disability as a basis, it primarily focuses on the attainment of civil rights (Dell Orto and Marinelli, 1995). But, unlike the social model, it seeks to neutralize the perceived negativity of impairment. This is accomplished, for instance, by claiming that wheelchair use is variation rather than limitation, and calling into question the normalcy of walking as a mode of mobility.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 44](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=67&annotation=3NCBQISY)) 少数模式是认为残障根本就不是障碍，二是一种选择，一种多样性的选择。  
这个感觉也可以be problematic，

“it is unclear why the label of disability or disability as an identity and minority claims related to culture must oppose one another—it seems that in order to make a “minority” claim, some believe that a “disability” identity must be shed or shifted elsewhere.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 44](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=67&annotation=NEVDZNRI)) 但这种少数群体模式一定会和其他模式互相排斥吗？有的人会觉得为了让少数模式work，必须把“disability”的身份给挪掉。

“Because funds available to persons with disabilities are limited and often far too low, part of “personal assistance activism” will be the attempt to keep payments for care work as low as possible in order to manage one’s budget. In other words, minority politics advocacy around “direct funding” pits persons with disabilities against care workers in a struggle over scarce resources. It places those with disabilities in a position of power over those workers who provide their care because little to no oversight is built in to the system (Kelly 2010). Paying higher amounts for care work means that those who need the care have less money in their already severely limited bank accounts.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=68&annotation=77HWQ4JV)) 在有限的funding资源下，care taker和残障人变成了敌人。  
感觉funding的有限永远是头顶上一把利剑……

“Christine Kelly argues that models for advocacy must shift and expand: “Advocacy around direct funding must expand in ways that understand personal assistance as ‘disabled work,’ that is, work that is inherently devalued in our society, just as disabled bodies are” (2010).” ([Hall, 2017, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=68&annotation=WD9B6P3H)) 帮助残障人的工作也是一种"disabled work"，是传统意义上被社会贬低的工作。

“Kelly here echoes theorist Rosemarie Garland-Thomson’s call to consider “disability” a “pervasive cultural category” (2001, 18). Garland-Thomson argues that disability should “be recognized as structuring a wide range of thought, language, and perception that might not be explicitly articulated as ‘disability’” (1997). This is a “universalizing rather than minoritizing” move that insists on bridging the binary between disability and ability in a celebration of difference” ([Hall, 2017, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=68&annotation=ZSJH5DHL)) Christine Kelly 提倡一种基于Rosemarie Garland-Thomson的广义文化模型，就是把残障作为一种文化模式，一种认知模式来看待，而不只是一种身份认同。这样的方式其实把残障的定义扩展了。

“Win contrast, when “disability” is taken up in the context of identity politics that pits one “minority” (marginalized) group against another, opposing lives and labors are devalued and obscured.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=68&annotation=YF87C2LJ)) 当残障被当作一种少数群体的时候，它势必也会挤压其他同类人和劳工的visibility。

“involves disability rights advocates directly in the management of their own disability “identity” and the work of policing the border between disability and ability. Seeing “disability” as another minority community pits this group against others in a struggle for rights and access, and further minoritizes and marginalizes persons with disabilities, emphasizing deviance from a norm. In an essay written from a Foucauldian point of view, Helen Liggett notes that “the minority group approach is double-edged because it means enlarging the discursive practices which participate in the constitution of disability . . . in order to participate in their own management disabled people have had to participate as disabled”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=69&annotation=UZSVMTYZ)) 残障作为少数群体是一把双刃剑——它虽然带来了有力的身份认同，但是同时也会进一步固化自己的身份以及

“The cultural model, exemplified by the work of Sharon Snyder and David Mitchell, seeks “locations” (contextualized constructions) of disability and deviance. It responds critically to the false choice of either the social world or the body as an explanatory mechanism. On the one hand, it claims that we can investigate the context and construction of disability without assuming that these contexts and constructions are merely or only tragic or negative—that is, the idea that disability marks “discriminatory encounters”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=69&annotation=FHKA2J43))

“the cultural model attempts to understand locations of disability as complex interplays between both embodiment and the social world, and so does not want to exclude individual (negative) experiences of stereotyping and problematic models like the medical model from an understanding of the way that individuals have built their identities” ([Hall, 2017, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=69&annotation=3F3VGI69)) 文化模式不会单纯为了反抗而否定有问题的模式对个人的影响。

“This means that the cultural model does not assume that disability is negative, but it can readily incorporate the workings of stigma and prejudice where they occur into an understanding of what disabilities, and disability identities, involve in a variety of contexts.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=69&annotation=YWVBFGJN)) 文化模式不卑不亢，不会认为残障就是糟糕的。

“In other words, the very desire transhumanists, bioethics literature, and biomedical contexts express to eliminate risk paradoxically produces and assigns risk to particular persons.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=142&annotation=VAA6SC5N)) transhumanism want to eliminate risk, which is using eliminating other people and community as sacrifice. They are saying disability = risk

“envisioning a utopia without risk creates risky techniques that literally kill and victimize particular persons.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=142&annotation=8GA83596)) 这句话说得太好了，想要建造一个没有risk的世界，实际上就是在区分哪样的人是“有risk” 的人

“In the milieu of genetic counseling, parents are asked to express their subjectivity as risk managers and particular populations become managed populations, marked in the womb as the bearers of contagious risk.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=142&annotation=U3ZW9SIA))

“Bioethics literature more largely is riddled with suggestions regarding the characteristics of the responsible medical subject. This responsible subject is a choice-maker, risk-averse and thoughtful, who plans for contingencies and successfully wields the power of attorney and pen” ([Hall, 2017, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=142&annotation=KS2EEJIK)) 生物伦理学中的医疗主题是一个理想化的主题——他们非常理性，非常会做选择，会规避风险，而且非常善用各种法律手段。但这种人在世界上可以说是不可能的存在的，因为人就是懒而且粗心而且不理性的。

([Hall, 2017, p. 119](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) 因为我们想象的医疗合同里的主体对象都是如此完美的人类，而大多数人做不到，于是我们就开始使用各种合约来规避个人的风险。我们的合约是不会管我们未来反悔与否，也不管我们未来是处在什么样的处境下。结果就是，我们本人也被迫需要想象我们在未来是怎样思考和行动的。

“Meanwhile, when we decide to reproduce, we are urged to meet with genetic counselors and discuss the likely attributes and quality of life of our progeny so that we can make “informed decisions” regarding how, when, and who to reproduce. Again, these processes are posed as risk assessment and parents are urged to be choice-makers even prior to the initiation of pregnancy. Parents are urged to create the best child possible, which most often means choosing not to produce other children whose embodiment is conceptually connected with risk and vulnerability.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 120](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=143&annotation=EZ6DCHKZ)) 父母被期待给孩子提供最好的条件，而“没有能力承担风险”的家长则被认为不适合生育，或者不完美的小孩被视为不太适合降生。

“In bioethics discourse, the responsible medical subject is the normal subject who chooses against risk. This normal subject is set up against the risky embodiment of others; these others are viewed as “abnormal” insofar as they are subject to chance and are seen as threats to the entire community” ([Hall, 2017, p. 120](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=143&annotation=ZTXTIRJC)) 在生物医学伦理的角度上来说，选择对抗风险，例如明知道小孩有残疾，还是把它生下来的人，是奇怪的。他们确实是“负有责任”的个体，但也是有危险性的。跟随而来的则是社会的介入——监管、排斥、风险控制……身体、人口和国家变成了这些操作的舞台。

“I can now name a central feature of utopian, enhanced futures: a chosen subject, selected because it is not marked by disability and so is thought to be impervious to chance. In the general case, utopian thinking obscures the present state of affairs by wishing fervently for a non-existing state of affairs, a non-place. Transhumanist utopian thinking focuses on a subject that is not real, a fantastic subject; that is, a techno-liberal subject that experiences proliferating choice. The most pernicious feature of transhumanist utopian thinking is that the non-existent subject obscures and devalues the lives of already-existing persons. It wishes fervently for a subject whose absolute autonomy is ensured via choice-making mediated through technology. To the transhumanist, embodiment appears as inherently risky and undesirable.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=150&annotation=YAEK6W9Z)) “超人类乌托邦思想关注的是一个并不真实的主体，一个梦幻般的主体；即一个经历着选择激增的技术自由主义主体。超人类乌托邦思想最有害的特点是，不存在的主体掩盖和贬低了已经存在的人的生活。”  
这就好像我为了逃避解决现有的问题，想要造更多工具，调查一些productivity方式来解决自己写东西的问题。虽然有时候确实有了工具会事半功倍，但找这些东西并不是在解决问题。有时候你必须得真正面对一些难题。

“The limitations of embodiment are made objects of fear in transhumanist thinking, and we frantically self-regulate in response to disciplinary and regulatory practices under a regime of biopower.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=8N7E56GY)) 对于transhumanist来说，身体的局限是令人恐惧的

“Inhabiting an open future is the underlying goal of enhancement, and the vision is created without reference to holding a future in common, open because we can be in control of it together. The transhumanist version of utopia is peopled by subjects autonomous in that they are undetermined by others—but mediated by technology, that is, techno-liberal subjects. Transhumanists seek this kind of absolute freedom, chosen and controlled individually.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=SJGLIJ6C)) "超人类主义者追求的就是这种由个人选择和控制的绝对自由。" transhumanist的未来是一个“开放”的未来，开放是在于我们有绝对的自定义化的权利，在于所有东西都是customizable的，甚至你的出生。

“In this vein, parents are urged to make choices in order to ensure the choice-making capability of their future children—that is, unencumbered space for individual autonomy.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=ZMB6TWPW)) 在“自由”的号召下，家长的职责也是提供尽可能多的可能性。  
这种可能性的爆炸也体现在了后现代的作品中——《瞬息全宇宙》和《万神殿》的结尾都是关于无限的可能，但似乎只是提出了某种悬而未决的疑惑，并最后以爱为名草草收场。  
但并没有解决的是这个先决的价值观——多多益善的选择，真的是自由的核心吗？如果是这样，人类永远会追求更多的选择，永远会后悔没有选择的方向。

“There is a move here from urging reproducers to seek comparatively enhanced choice-making capabilities in future children (better, more, greater, most opportunity) to urging reproducers to seek an absolute choice-making character for their future child ensuring that child will experience no interference from chance.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=SL479YNA)) 以前的家长需要让孩子能够有更好，更多，更棒的机会，而在基因技术下，家长被敦促生产一种没有“意外”的孩子。

“For the transhumanist, in order to achieve this end, the risks of embodiment must be subverted through reproductive choice-making. Choice-making is both the goal and the means of enhancement. To control the future and force it “open,” the transhumanist must absolutely determine it and attempt to preclude determination from any other source (anything or anyone else). The future is open to me when it is chosen by me.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=WMITWL26)) 怪不得万神殿最后一集是关于Maddie在无数中选择里找出最合适的那一个。这才是transhumanist的终极观点——并不是我要拥有更多更好的未来可能性，而是更进一步——我要能够掌控所有未来的可能性——不论是通过基因选择，还是放弃肉身。未来对我来说是开放的，而且是由我选择的。

“Disability traits are read by both Bostrom and Savulescu as risks—possible limitations on future freedoms. The transhumanist subject, by contrast, must be one that engenders no risks. A body carrying a disability trait, then, is this subject’s opposite; it is viewed purely as risk through genetic counseling and figured as avoidable determination.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=58AVNQR5)) 一个transhumnist的身体应该是无暇的，没有任何风险的。而残障的身体则暴露着各种各样的风险。  
所以风险到底是什么？或者说风险是一定要规避的东西吗？为什么作者这么执着于chance的重要性呢？

“In sum, transhumanists seek to improve life through biotechnology. But, the notion transhumanists have of improvement is rooted in utopia, specifically a utopian subject: the technoliberal individual.” ([Hall, 2017, p. 128](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=151&annotation=33BHVZVI)) transhumanist的未来是一个过于狭窄和精确的未来——一个特定的好以及让人有满足感的生活。

“Foucault notes that under biopower, death takes multiple forms: “When I say ‘killing,’ I obviously do not mean simply murder as such, but also every form of indirect murder: the fact of exposing someone to death, increasing the risk of death for some people, or, quite simply, political death, expulsion, rejection, and so on”” ([Hall, 2017, p. 129](zotero://select/library/items/8EKADAQX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQGII3WY?page=152&annotation=6WTVJYC4)) 福科认为杀人不只是字面意义上
