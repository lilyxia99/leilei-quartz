## Review

### The more intimate, the more difficult

The author missed a performance of Adrian Howells, and The author's seek to care and forgiveness is not to make Howell feel better, but **to make the author feel better**. It also becomes part of the work of "Held"--as Adrian Howells's work is about intimacy and care-taking. 

Probably out of an attempt to make themselves feel better, started to think maybe they are subconsciously trying to avoid this "hard performance", and started thinking of how this seemingly tender and intimate performance could be challenging. It's the emotion, they argued, that is more challenging than blood or nudity. 

The blood and attack might not be even more challenging than intimacy. Intimacy, care and trust is what's even more dangerous. The more tactile is the more intrusive, the more spectacle could be the more detached.

情感会让一个作品对某一个人来说变得容易，对另一个人来说变得很难吗？当然会的吧，这都是因为我们太在意其他人的看法了。情感里的一部分或许就是来自于人际关系。 It's more provoking when an artworks stimulates feeling rather than just letting it plainly flows. Facing this kind of works, critic could be very biased  and even frightened, because it's uncool to be "moved". Taste is not only about the appreciation of art. It's essentially inter-personal relationships, and both are so at stake for critics:

>it can be hard to have intense feelings in museums when those feelings go against social protocol. In an art gallery, anger, tears, arousal, and certain kinds of laughter may appear to signal the disintegration of composure, **naïveté, and a lack of class**. In such spaces, as much as we are encouraged to be moved by works of art, we are also encouraged to **remain cool.**..The museum as a whole, as an ideological home, does not welcome us equally.

Adrian Howells is challenging in its contradictory intimacy and publicness. 明明家庭是一个温馨私密的空间，但是在美术馆里却变成了一种奇怪的混合产物——一方面它在构造这种真诚的互动，另一方面它是一种展示.[^family]  这种又公共又亲密的体验是一种**extimate**，某种意义上约炮或者搭子是否也是这样？艺术家或者观众在这里变成了如同性工作者一样的存在，然而性工作者的行为本身就是被边缘化的。

另一方面让这样的体验变得艰难的，是面对亲密离开时候的感伤。我们都知道这是**灰姑娘的水晶鞋**，过了十二点就会消失。我们享受着虚假的幸福，但是在真实的痛楚来临之时变得格外悲伤。 因为我们依赖的是一种外界的给予，而非我们自身的力量和勇气吧。如果存在和非存在都是持续存在，而非二元对立的时候，这种分离的焦虑是不是就会消失呢？

The author mentions that people have a far higher standard for contemporary artworks than films. It's okay to be shocked, grossed, moved by films, but rare and uncomfortable if you feel the same in a gallery. 例如拉斯冯提尔的作品就是非常“难看”，但是不妨他依旧混得风生水起。Maggie Nelson 评价拉斯冯提尔的作品是不可原谅而且自我正当化的。拉斯冯提尔的电影出名，并非是出自别的事情，而**正是因为它的残酷**。_它把 "事情的真相 "说成是现实主义，说成是真知灼见，而实际上却是纯粹的意识形态。_ 单纯地呈现恶，在揭露的同时，也在将其**正当化，平凡化，景观化，更加地常态化**。[^cruel]

### To argue for literalness

>There’s so much art out there that doesn’t read. The information is so oblique that you can’t get it unless there’s a library next to it.

this is so true. there r so many works that relies on the wall text instead of its actual affect, and it turns into an insider work of which the significance can only be understood by people who are familiar with art history. 很多艺术制造某种只有小圈子才能get到的黑话和玩笑。Art criticism has formed a solid bias--difficulty to understand = information not available. = cool = anti-emotional. 这种不可解读性被直接售卖为艺术[^opacity]  这种不透明性只是在铸造新的长城，维护一种等级化的，不是inaccessible 的品味。这是国家文化能力的象征——既然是高品位，必须是精英 ，怎能是这么直白好懂的？

在当代艺术圈里，似乎==某种直白的表达是不被待见的==。有时候人们不会直说这个作品的争议，而是会去说这个作品==天真，直白，没有美感==。 这听上去像是我在说的事情……这么一想，实际上虽然我不喜欢那件在墙上写男女骂人标语的作品，但实际上它确认展现了一些东西，同时也引发了人们的思考。这是人们不愿意面对的暴力。言之有物总比空洞的比喻要好。

当然，政治审查在这里面也是有见解影响的。90年代的时候，NEA 赞助的资金不会赞助描写同性恋或者可能冒犯宗教观众的作品。虽然现在不是这样，但是这确实也产生了一些影响。[^90s] As an example of how government and institutional machine could see artworks as extra-difficult, the author mentions Ricardo Dominguez, who was accused by his artworks of helping immigrant to get water in desert. [^Ricardo Dominguez] _在墨西哥和美国边境地区的'死亡季节'将水藏起来，作为一种类似的自发释放行为--不是作为一种政治声明（或者不仅仅是政治声明），而是作为一种身体反射，作为一种直观的伦理姿态，坚持'不要在我的眼皮底下_ 。[^feeding action]母亲的身体是死的，但是喂养的动作却如同处于本能一样，在边境储水本身是一种对于生存的直觉反应——不管你跨越边境是否到的，既然你在这儿了，我**不容你在我眼皮底下受难而没有尊严地死去**。虽然本身这个行为高度政治性，但是实际想想，这是一种充满了情感的动作。[^mother]  

### 争议和时代

而这一发现似乎也得益于像Beck这样的保守派的"close reading"。如果我们仅仅以我们的视角去控诉不理解的人怎么怎么保守和顽固不化，*我们永远没有办法真正地去讨论这个作品。我们会不断地抱怨大环境，但实际上可能是黑子才会对作品才“真正地”仔细研究过。* 他们吹毛求疵，正是因为他们用显微镜看每一个可以被攻击的点。他们对作品的关注可能甚至大过对作品吹捧，但是只是泛泛地欢迎**样板戏**的人。[^haters] 如果仅仅是talk over each other，不论是正方还是反方，都抑制了我们讨论作品本身的可能性。正方只会不断地责备大环境的不好，就像认为《大雨》《姜子牙》难看就是一盖帽审查。所以==sit with your enemy, you will find more about yourself==. 

为什么艺术这么容易引起争议和拒绝呢？艺术界希望艺术像科学一样“改变生活”（tool本身就永远是改变生活的东西，否则无法称之为tool）另一方面希望艺术能够真的改变社会秩序和不平等，让大家自我感觉良好。作者认为，如果能做到这一点，那往往它一定是个革命性的。或许这是因为当它真实地解决了一些问题的时候，它就必然是政治性的，而政治性往往会触动某些人的奶酪。[^solve] 运动的受伤风险恐怕比艺术的风险要大得多，但是如果停止体育赛事是粉丝们不会同意的。艺术的争议比体育更大，因为在艺术里，观众冒的风险除了“感受”，别无其它——或者至少这是一个预期。[^sports] 

>The legislative marks against federal support of overtly political art has been echoed by art critics who ==**dismiss overtly political work as naïve, literalist forms of propaganda**== disengaged from aesthetics and art history....Emotion, especially when coupled with a ==legible politics==, appears as critically indigestible matter, a roadblock to “serious” criticism (Doyle, 2013, p. 12)

damn，这不就是我吗。我就挺不喜欢很直白的政治作品的。对我来说这有一种哗众取宠的感觉。如果是可以被解读的政治作品，就是无聊的，就是literal的，就是没有严肃叙事的。[^boring] 

面对有争议的作品，仅仅是拒绝并不是一种有效率的讨论方式——**拒绝包含了全盘转向和全盘接受**。事实上，即便这种争议令我们沮丧，==这种沮丧和拒绝的态度也inform 了我们是谁==。 [^informed]  Dominguez的作品不仅仅是作品本身，也包括外界的反应以及艺术家本身的持续维护，让这个作品继续生存下去。[^survive] 对于这个作品来说，争议是计划中的一部分。即便是转头不去看，你也是受到了这个作品的影响——你被刺激去look away。或许是彻底的无视才是最糟糕的。厌恶或者是喜欢都是一个作品成功的标志。[^lookAway]

但是对于很多其他艺术家来说，争议一般是具有伤害性的。[^contraversy] 争议最终是一种转移注意力，是一种极致的简化。我们讨论的“困难”不是作品本身的困难，而是the difficulties for us to 直面这些困难。Athey的表演因为它用血的桥段被污蔑而引起争议性，这种争议里面存在诸多媒体的误解和信息暴力。民众和媒体不会关心这个表演其实完全和政府资金没啥关系，只用了200刀的小赞助。即便是用了20刀，即便艺术家本人从来没有申请过类似的奖项，这也是一个“政府资助”的项目。[^Athey] 

>[!note]
>但是being literal是不是有一些不同的spectrum呢？我感觉也有一些不同程度的being literal。或许我不太喜欢那种像拉斯冯提尔式的literal——揭示了暴力，但似乎只是变成了一种**暴露疗法**。[^1] 是不是也不能直接就把hard and difficult art 和有意义划等号？感觉作者对于现代艺术作品就有一些格外的关照，当ta在讨论电影的时候可不是这样的。  当然，可能可以argue对于像战争片，科幻灾难片之类的作品，这种痛苦是作为一种娱乐和消费品。但难道在当代艺术中不是的吗？还是说因为它没有提供一个happy ending，所以它并不是一种廉价的景观了？

### Limitation of art critic

>I argue that the literalism attributed by some art historians and critics to certain kinds of work (engaged with questions of history, identity, and identification and almost always by artists of color, feminists, and queer artists) reflects a critical limit, and not a limit to the work itself. 

critical distance似乎是一个评论家很看重的东西, and the "difficult art" for general public might be exactly the comfort zone for art historian, whereas the "difficult art" for art historian might be something that they can't conclude with their pre-existing contemporary art context--==the emotional, marginal, underground art==.[^comfort] 

很有意思的是似乎杜尚带领现代艺术进入了某种观念性的时代，但现在我们需要的其实是解构这种观念的霸权。  [^Direct] 但我的问题恰恰也来源于此：_到底什么情况下，直白是可取的，什么情况下它只是可悲的缺乏想象力的照搬说教？

乐理里本身就会把声音分成乐音和噪音，这种二分法就像你是英勇牺牲的还是在恐怖主义袭击中自杀的一样，是被某种音乐的审美所控制的。[^music] 

## Annotations  
(1/28/2024, 4:39:47 PM)

“Critics can be tone deaf; we can miss the pleasures others take, ignore the irritation that others feel. We can be willful and stubborn, blind to the dwindling relevance of those artists we love and indifferent to the emergence of new practices we don’t understand.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 1) ~~critic could be very biased~~

“Howells’s work maximizes the possibilities of what he describes as “accelerated intimacy.” He has explored the contours of confession and autobiography in performances that rehearse the most painful and embarrassing moments in his history for small audiences, and sometimes audiences of one.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 2)

“Apparently I couldn’t inhabit the structure of that encounter without being overwhelmed—by what, though?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 3) 

“What happens at the end of the appointment? I was attracted enough to the idea to schedule the appointment but disturbed enough that I made it impossible for me to honor it. In doing so, I subconsciously preempted the betrayal I expected, for the experience of Held would feel either very empty and disappointing or very full and disappointing. I had reacted badly to what Jon Cairns describes as the “confusing context of ‘staged’ intimacy” in which Howells works.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 3)

“by trekking down there anyway to solicit his forgiveness, I managed to extract the caretaking that Howells offered within the boundaries of Held but outside the boundaries of the event. I insisted on getting what I thought the artist had promised me, but on my own terms, and after blowing him off. (Of course, behind this self-analysis are years of therapy. The responsibility to each other’s time is one of the first things one works through with an analyst, especially if one has missed an appointment or is habitually late.)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 3) ~~Howells's work is about intimacy and care-taking while the fact that the author was late and still seek that care and forgiveness, is not to make Howell feel better, but **to make the author feel better**. It also becomes part of the work of "Held"~~

“I was cavalier about my own limits and dismissive of others’, as if it were a moral failing to be averse to the sight of blood or be uncomfortable with the idea of live performances engaging in acts that look (and sometimes are) sexual. Howells showed me how deluded I’d been: the mere idea of certain kinds of performance provoked in me a defensive need to assert control over my place in the picture. As a spectator to performance art, I might have a high tolerance for blood, nudity, and noise, but I seem to have a lower tolerance for work engaged with more ordinary forms of relational intimacy, for the things that “feel” like life and therefore cut too close.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 4) ~~The blood and attack might not be even more challenging than intimacy. Intimacy, care and trust is what's even more dangerous. The more tactile is the more intrusive, the more spectacle could be the more detached.~~

“Emotion can make our experience of art harder, but it also makes that experience more interesting. It may make things harder because the work provokes unpleasant or painful feelings.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 4) ~~It's more provoking when an artworks stimulates feeling rather than just letting it plainly flows~~.

“For all the ways that emotion animates the way we talk about art—being “carried away” or “moved” by the beauty of a painting, for example—it can be hard to have intense feelings in museums when those feelings go against social protocol. In an art gallery, anger, tears, arousal, and certain kinds of laughter may appear to signal the disintegration of composure, naïveté, and a lack of class. In such spaces, as much as we are encouraged to be moved by works of art, we are also encouraged to remain cool” (Doyle, 2013, p. 4)

“questions of aesthetic judgment are questions of taste and that they are historically and socially conditioned.2 They reflect and reproduce the values of a class. What you enjoy, how you enjoy it, and how you express that enjoyment can reveal a lot about who you are and where you come from” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5) ~~Taste is not only about the appreciation of art. It's essentially inter-personal relationships~~.

“Many find themselves at odds with a world in which appearing to be cool and aloof is the mark of sophistication.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5) 确实，在美术馆里保持高冷才会受到尊敬，即便是喜欢的作品也得表现地卓尔不群。 ^68aab3

“The museum as a whole, as an ideological home, does not welcome us equally.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5)

“As critics, what are our responsibilities toward work that quite literally takes us out of our comfort zone, and toward the audiences who seek out these experiences?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5)

“I thought of a sentimental pop song as like a sentimental novel or film, as if sentimentality were a thing in and of itself, which a text might embody and communicate.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6)

“The coziness of the domestic space is a lure; as any student of sentimental fiction knows, homes are haunted. Howells invites his audience into a queer space of intimacy whose edges are shaped by failure and isolation. (What domestic scene isn’t?)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) _家庭空间的温馨是一种诱惑；任何一个研究情感小说的人都知道，家是闹鬼的地方。豪厄尔斯邀请他的读者进入一个由失败和孤独塑造边缘的同性恋亲密空间。(哪个家庭场景不是如此呢？）_

“this home were a bordello offering not the sexual excitement of the mistress but the grounding companionship of the wife.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6)

[^family]:“how overdetermined that scene of domestic intimacy is for many of us. Cairns therefore describes the artist as practicing an ambivalent form of intimacy—a fundamentally queer occupation of domestic, personal, feminine, and reproductive scenes in which sites associated with privacy and safety become instead scenes of exposure” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) ~~明明家庭是一个温馨私密的空间，但是在美术馆里却变成了一种奇怪的混合产物——一方面它在构造这种真诚的互动，另一方面它是一种展示~~

“Lauren Berlant describes these kinds of spaces as “intimate publics”; Tavia Nyong’o uses the term extimate to suggest how they can fail, leaving us feeling more alone than ever.5” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) ~~这种又公共又亲密的体验是一种extimate，某种意义上约炮或者搭子是否也是这样？  
我们都知道这是灰姑娘的水晶鞋，过了十二点就会消失。我们享受着虚假的幸福，但是在真实的痛楚来临之时变得格外悲伤。  ~~
  
~~因为我们依赖的是一种外界的给予，而非我们自身的力量和勇气吧。如果存在和非存在都是持续存在，而非二元对立的时候，这种分离的焦虑是不是就会消失呢？~~

“what makes a work hard for one person and easy for another.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) ~~情感会让一个作品对某一个人来说变得容易，对另一个人来说变得很难吗？当然会的吧，这都是因为我们太在意其他人的看法了。情感里的一部分或许就是来自于人际关系。~~

“one might ask why we are prepared to accept the value of feeling bad when we read a novel, for example, but are less prepared to do so when we go to a museum. Why is it easier for us to watch an upsetting movie than it is to keep company with contemporary art that makes similar emotional demands on us? Why should the idea of attending Howells’s performance be more unsettling than sitting through a movie like Secrets and Lies (1996) or Steel Magnolias (1989)?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 7) Is that true? is that true that we are less prepared to be disappointed by contemporary art? I don't think so.

“Maggie Nelson describes that director’s cruelty as both unforgiving and self-righteous:” (Doyle, 2013, p. 7) ~~Maggie Nelson 评价拉斯冯提尔的作品是不可原谅而且自我正当化的。~~

[^cruel]:“Thus this kind of work accrues cultural value not in spite of its cruelty but because of it: it rationalizes the brutality of the status quo. It presents “the way things are” as realism, as insight, when in fact it is pure ideology.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~拉斯冯提尔的电影出名，并非是出自别的事情，而正是因为它的残酷。_它把 "事情的真相 "说成是现实主义，说成是真知灼见，而实际上却是纯粹的意识形态。_ 单纯地呈现恶，在揭露的同时，也在将其正当化，平凡化，景观化，更加地常态化。~~

“Lucy Lippard expresses sympathy with a similar complaint lodged by Wojnarowicz. Writing about the contrast between the “literalness” of his work and the opacity of the work of his contemporaries, he observes, “~~There’s so much art out there that doesn’t read. The information is so oblique that you can’t get it unless there’s a library next to it.~~” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~this is so true. there r so many works that relies on the wall text instead of its actual affect.
~~
“Creating an elite in the art world, in terms of how one gets the joke or can understand the information, is no better than what happens in the larger social structure.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~制造某种只有小圈子才能get到的黑话和玩笑，只是在铸造新的长城。并没有起到艺术应有的作用。~~

“why the fear that it is uncool to show feelings on surface, to explain one’s work in the titles or captions, seems so universally internalized.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~在当代艺术圈里，似乎某种直白的表达是不被待见的。~~

“Art criticism has aligned one form of difficulty (in which a work’s meaning is not readily available to the viewer) with a regulation of affect (in which opacity, the difficulty of meaning, is packaged as cool, distanced, and antiemotional).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~art criticism has formed a solid bias--difficulty to understand = information not available. = cool = anti-emotional~~

[^opacity]: “sell this marriage of the impenetrable and the unmovable as Art” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~这种不可解读性被直接售卖为艺术。~~

[^90s]:“The moral panic of the decade led to the adoption of an antiobscenity clause in the administration of nea funding (eventually found unconstitutional) that prohibited the use of federal funding to support work that depicted homosexuality or that might offend religious viewers (for starters).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 9) ~~90年代的时候，NEA 赞助的资金不会赞助描写同性恋或者可能冒犯宗教观众的作品。虽然现在不是这样，但是这确实也产生了一些影响。~~

[^Ricardo Dominguez]:“Ricardo Dominguez. He is an electronic artist, a founding member of Electronic Disturbance Theater, and a tenured professor at University of California, San Diego. In 2010 Dominguez and his collaborators at b.a.n.g.lab came under investigation for criminal charges related to his work on “virtual sit-ins” (legal forms of electronic protest). He was also accused of misusing university resources in the development of b.a.n.g.lab’s Transborder Immigrant Tool, a mobile phone application designed to guide people crossing the Mexico-U.S. border to water caches. (Thousands have died of dehydration in making this journey.) The application also offers lines of poetry inspired by the desert’s landscape. Members of the U.S. Congress petitioned the University of California to investigate the artist for violating Section 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, for, in their words, “encouraging aliens to illegally enter the United States.”15” (Doyle, 2013, p. 9) Ricardo Dominguez is accused by his artworks. But this is quite different from Lars Von Tier's films, which are fictions. These are real activism, isn't it?

[^the feeding action]:“The b.a.n.g.lab artists write of the mother’s experience of the “letdown,” in which her body responds to her infant’s cry by producing milk. They ask, “What if we made the desert into such a body? . . . Imagine caching water in the Mexican-U.S. borderlands’ ‘season of dying’ as a comparable act of spontaneous release—not as a political statement (or not only that) but as a corporeal reflex, as an intuitive ethical gestus to insist, ‘not on my watch.’”16” (Doyle, 2013, p. 10) ~~_在墨西哥和美国边境地区的'死亡季节'将水藏起来，作为一种类似的自发释放行为--不是作为一种政治声明（或者不仅仅是政治声明），而是作为一种身体反射，作为一种直观的伦理姿态，坚持'不要在我的眼皮底下_  
  ~~
  
[^mother]:~~母亲的身体是死的，但是喂养的动作却如同处于本能一样，在边境储水本身是一种对于生存的直觉反应——不管你跨越边境是否到的，既然你在这儿了，我不容你在我眼皮底下受难而没有尊严地死去。这是一种充满了情感的动作。~~

[^solve]:“The Transborder Immigrant Tool hysterically embodies Art’s conflict with itself: the desire that it have the value of a science—that its impact on the world be something we can measure and demonstrate—and the desire that art make us all feel better (about ourselves and the world) by actually redressing social inequity (but not really). An object that really did do all of these things might indeed be criminal. Or revolutionary.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) ~~艺术界希望艺术像科学一样“改变生活”（tool本身就永远是改变生活的东西，否则无法称之为tool）另一方面希望艺术能够真的改变社会秩序和不平等，让大家自我感觉良好。作者认为，如果能做到这一点，那往往它一定是个革命性的。或许这是因为当它真实地解决了一些问题的时候，它就必然是政治性的，而政治性往往会触动某些人的奶酪。~~

[^survive]:“The Transborder Immigrant Tool was projected into a conflict zone. Its authors are as much new media activists as artists. (Dominguez’s work can’t be thought of as one or the other; it should be treated as both.) The work here is not limited to the object; it includes public discourse about that object and the interventions of the artists themselves in the media. (The artists continue to index the application’s use and public discourse about it and about the border.)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) ~~Dominguez的作品不仅仅是作品本身，也包括外界的反应以及艺术家本身的持续维护，让这个作品继续生存下去。~~

[^contraversy]:“The project itself was designed to fold those battles into its content. Many artists whose work becomes controversial intend no such thing. Controversy’s impact on artists who are not media activists is more often than not corrosive and unrecoverable.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) ~~对于这个作品来说，争议是计划中的一部分。但是对于很多其他艺术家来说，争议一般是具有伤害性的。~~

“One of our performance projects, titled Mapa Corpo (2004), was rejected by a dozen U.S. museums and universities when they learned the nature of the central image: a nude body covered with 40 acupuncture needles, each bearing a small flag of one of the “coalition forces.” Audience members were invited “to decolonize the body/map of the performer” by extracting a needle/flag. After so many rejections” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) 原来美国也存在审查的问题，对于裸体和对于colonial话题的审查。不过是一个裸体上面插满了针灸针，每一根针上面有旗子嘛。说实话我感觉美国人对于这样的审查真是有点大惊小怪了，问问中国人你就知道这种审查可只是毛毛雨罢了。

[^1]:~~“The legislative marks against federal support of overtly political art has been echoed by art critics who dismiss overtly political work as naïve, literalist forms of propaganda disengaged from aesthetics and art history.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 12) damn，这不就是我吗。我就挺不喜欢很直白的政治作品的。对我来说这有一种哗众取宠的感觉。但是being literal是不是有一些不同的spectrum呢？我感觉也有一些不同程度的being literal。或许我不太喜欢那种像拉斯冯提尔式的literal——揭示了暴力，但似乎只是变成了一种**暴露疗法**。~~

[^boring]:“For such critics, when this kind of work turns to the social, it turns away from art itself. This is the affectively deadened landscape to which Lippard and Wojnarowicz gesture. ~~Emotion, especially when coupled with a legible politics, appears as critically indigestible matter, a roadblock to “serious” criticism~~.18 (How this has happened is discussed in more detail in chapter 3.)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 12) ~~如果是可以被解读的政治作品，就是无聊的，就是literal的，就是没有严肃叙事的。~~

““How far is too far?” and “When does art cross the line from avant-garde to unacceptable?”19 That is basically all that the author asks of a work that dared to engage the subject of abortion.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 12)

“was ignored in favor of a review of “shock art.” That sort of writing erases the differences between controversial practices by lumping them together in a catalogue of insult to taste and quality, as if all insults (or even all work about abortion) were alike. A genuine discussion of how diverse art practices actually work is sacrificed in favor of a sensationalist story about shock. This book aims to move past the tabloid-style headlines that limit critical engagement with hard art to the question asked of the Transborder Immigrant Tool: “Is it art, or is it a crime?”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13) 并不是所有引起人惊呼的做剖都是shock art，当然也不代表所有的惊奇都是有意义的，就像saltburn里的猎奇不见得就是有意义的猎奇，

[^haters]:“That conversation suppresses the existence of the work’s core audience: the people who actively seek it out, who follow the artist’s career and give themselves over to the work’s processes. When we take a defensive position, we tell a story about controversy and the art world or controversy and a homophobic, racist, or sexist public sphere.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13) ~~如果我们仅仅以我们的视角去控诉不理解的人怎么怎么保守和顽固不化，我们永远没有办法真正地去讨论这个作品。我们会不断地抱怨大环境，但实际上可能是黑子才会对作品才“真正地”仔细研究过。他们吹毛求疵，正是因为他们用显微镜看每一个可以被攻击的点。他们对作品的关注可能甚至大过对作品吹捧，但是只是泛泛地欢迎一种样板戏的人。~~

“Controversy’s undertow draws us away from the work, away from its community and its politics, and has us all talking about museums, galleries, and fundamentalists.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13)

[^infomed]:“The audience’s limits figure explicitly in such work, and clearly we need to think carefully about how these limits ought to inform our critical practices. The defensive critical posture we adopt in the face of controversy fails us because it does not give us room to acknowledge how much failure, refusal, and rejection inform the poetics of the works in question” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13) ~~面对有争议的作品，仅仅是拒绝并不是一种有效率的讨论方式。事实上，即便这种争议令我们沮丧，这种沮丧和拒绝的态度也inform 了我们是谁。  ~~
  
~~虽然但是，是不是也不能直接就把hard and difficult art 和有意义划等号？感觉作者对于现代艺术作品就有一些格外的关照，当ta在讨论电影的时候可不是这样的。  
  
~~当然，可能可以argue对于像战争片，科幻灾难片之类的作品，这种痛苦是作为一种娱乐和消费品。但难道在当代艺术中不是的吗？还是说因为它没有提供一个happy ending，所以它并不是一种廉价的景观了？~~

“The diverting of attention from that which is meant to compel it, i.e. the actual work on display, can at times free up a recognition that other manifestations are taking place that are often difficult to read, and which may be as significant as the designated objects on display.”20” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) 当我们想要转头不去看的时候，这种回避恰恰也说明了什么。  
  
确实，如果是下意识的回避，那么这种回避本身就对这名观众来说有意义了。但是如果说对于一个观众，它并不惊奇，却在惊奇的他同时让人觉得无可奈何和景观化呢？这是我不喜欢的类型。

[^lookAway]:“The decision to look away, Rogoff writes, can also be a decision to look around—to experience the contiguity of art with the social spaces that surround it. Rogoff calls for “expanding the parameters of what constitutes engagement with art.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) ~~即便是转头不去看，你也是受到了这个作品的影响——你被刺激去关注周围的环境。或许是彻底的无视才是最糟糕的。厌恶或者是喜欢都是一个作品成功的标志。~~

““we rarely question . . . what constitutes the listening, hearing, or seeing in and of itself,” and so our perspectives can be blind to the larger social and political resonance of the practices of artists and their publics.21” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) We can probably expand the area of experience of art to more than just within the museum space. Our individual life outside of that visit is also part of that experience.

“contemporary art criticism and art history, in that scholars who write about historical and social contexts are often accused of abandoning the work of art. Rogoff ’s strategic decision to refuse that zero-sum logic of choice (in which one either talks about the work itself or looks away, to its politics) is important to this book because much of the work I discuss is not structured by that opposition.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) one of the core position of this book is to abandon the binary of talk about the work vs. talk about the context

“Is Held the encounter between the artist and his visitor? If so, where does that encounter begin and end?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) 如果一个作品能产生久久的回响，说明这个作品是成功的。能被记起的时候，它的作品就在那里。

“The works of art I discuss here all exploit the watery nature of emotion; this is the primary reason it can be hard (or pointless) to stabilize their boundaries as works of art. Performance art offers a particularly rich context for exploring questions regarding the presence of emotion, audience, and event.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15)

“Many of the artists most frequently identified as controversial and shockingsuch as Jeff Koons, Vanessa Beecroft, and Santiago Sierra—don’t make work that is actually all that difficult.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15)

“How difficult can Beecroft’s work be, really, when even as we complain about its exploitative structures, reproductions of her work grace the covers of art magazines?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15) 如果一个作品受到了媒体的关注，那它会自动变成作者会口诛笔伐的对象吗？

“What do we have to say about artists who aren’t making art about Art but about the Mexico-U.S. border, about intimacy and exposure, or in response to a culture of hate and fear?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15) challenging的作品不一定是对过去艺术传统的challenge。

“controversial and obscene in a reception history that has made it almost impossible to access the actual nature of his performances.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16) 很有意思的是CHRISTINE其实就出现在了Dallas美术馆里，但是当ta出现的时候，你似乎是觉得Dallas配不上ta。这不是一个上流社会认可的问题，这就是一个你这个场子是否能燥起来的问题。

“Reviewing Athey’s place in performance scholarship, Dominic Johnson writes, “To broach the relations between Athey and varied and often uncategorisable exiles in the hinterlands of cultural practice—such as Genesis P-Orridge, Kembra Pfahler or Johanna Went—is to ask, implicitly, why so little scholarship exists about their achievements.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16)

“In other words, Athey’s work is hard for critics to engage because it isn’t primarily in dialogue with a specific academic canon. His work may cite Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean Genet, Pierre Molinier, and Francis Bacon, but its genealogy also includes death rock, disco, s&m culture, punk, radical theater, and Pentecostal ritual. Athey’s performances developed from s&m tableaux staged at Los Angeles’s Club Fuck! and moved into theater and gallery spaces—without, however leaving behind either the ethos or the audience of his club roots.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16) 当一个作品的发源来自亚文化，它就很容易被主流遗忘和主动忽视。这让我想到wren的作品还有各种net art。

“Underground artists are underground precisely because they work off the disciplinary grid, spatially and conceptually. This is a choice artists will make and revisit throughout the arc of their development, as they continue to work outside commercial spaces or decide to find a way into them” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16)

“It was erroneously reported, by a writer who had not attended the performance, that the audience had been exposed to hiv-positive blood (Ron has lived with hiv for the past 20 years; Carlton is not positive).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 17)

“The controversy was over less than two hundred dollars of nea funding used by the Walker Center to produce the event” (Doyle, 2013, p. 17)

[^Athey]:“such attacks on public support of the arts are not about what federal funding actually does but what people imagine it might do, who and what it could support.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 19) ~~Athey的表演因为它用血的桥段被污蔑而引起争议性，这种争议里面存在诸多媒体的误解和信息暴力。民众和媒体不会关心这个表演其实完全和政府资金没啥关系，只用了200刀的小赞助。即便是用了20刀，即便艺术家本人从来没有申请过类似的奖项，这也是一个“政府资助”的项目。~~

“A lot of people get nervous about blood (giving it, the sight of it, coming into contact with it). When someone is bleeding as part of a performance, there are of course steps one takes to minimize risk of exposure. Lack of familiarity with those protocols makes the idea of blood in performance even more intimidating.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 19)

[^sports]: “The idea of shutting down the sport spectacle would strike fans as bizarre, but the controversy produced around art should strike people as even crazier,” (Doyle, 2013, p. 19) ~~运动的受伤风险恐怕比艺术的风险要大得多，但是如果停止体育赛事是粉丝们不会同意的。艺术的争议比体育更大，因为在艺术里，观众冒的风险除了“感受”，别无其它——或者至少这是一个预期。~~

“People are anxious about what is going to happen at an Athey performance—not to him, but to them. Athey developed his signature blood-work pieces in the midst of the aids crisis. The protocols of safer sex as well as the medical handling of the sick body are sometimes as much a part of his performances as are sadomasochistic practices. And the two are deeply related in his work.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20)

“But the enduring difficulty of Athey’s work is more closely tied to the way that it mixes pleasure and pain—and does so in spectacles that speak to larger social experiences of belonging and alienation, care and abandonment, hope and despair” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20) Athey的作品形成的景观，是如何对社会体验产生对话的呢？

“the things that make Athey’s performances hard for some people are not all that different from the things that make Adrian Howells’s seemingly tame performances hard for others. They are not that different from what is hard about Linda Montano’s performance video, Mitchell’s Death. These are the things that, in fact, make life hard. They are productive and important kinds of difficulty—not because they expand our ideas of what constitutes Art but because they speak to quite fundamental aspects of being a social subject” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20) 这里没懂。意思是ta的spectacle有助于让人们意识到自己这个时代的一些议题，例如血液、艾滋之类的吗？

“The controversy that surrounds Athey’s work is engineered to keep us from thinking about and working through these aspects of its difficulty. Attention to a work’s controversy actually suppresses attention to a work’s difficulty.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20) ~~争议，不论是正方还是反方，都抑制了我们讨论作品本身的可能性。ta实际上是一种转移注意力。我们讨论的“困难”不是作品本身的困难，而是the difficulties for us to 直面这些困难。~~

“translation of difficulty into scandal, the secret of which is constructed as always already known, relieving the critic of the need to discuss it.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) 一旦争议变成丑闻，艺术评论家就不需要讨论这件事情了。

[^naiive]:“The difficulty of the artworks discussed in this book is tied to their emotional and identificatory geometries. That difficulty has been flattened by traditional critical practices. Because this kind of work is shaped by a comingling of narrative, feelings, and politics it can appear to some critics as naïve and propagandistic, especially when race and gender are on the table.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) ~~有时候人们不会直说这个作品的争议，而是会去说这个作品天真，直白，没有美感。  ~~
  
~~这听上去像是我在说的事情……这么一想，实际上虽然我不喜欢那件在墙上写男女骂人标语的作品，但实际上它确认展现了一些东西，同时也引发了人们的思考。这是人们不愿意面对的暴力。言之有物总比空洞的比喻要好。~~

[^critical]:“these “discourse-specific practices” often seek out a relationship with “the other” and risk an overidentification with the subject “othered” by the discourse these artists engage, in a collapse of critical distance” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) ~~critical distance似乎是一个评论家很看重的东西~~

“Foster worries that in such work (often autobiographical and overtly political) “an ideal practice might be projected onto the field of the other, which is then asked to reflect it as if it were not only authentically indigenous but innovatively political.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21)

[^Direct]:“I argue that the literalism attributed by some art historians and critics to certain kinds of work (engaged with questions of history, identity, and identification and almost always by artists of color, feminists, and queer artists) reflects a critical limit, and not a limit to the work itself. In fact that desire to read artists as having “ethnographer envy,” as so many relics and theoretical primitives, is anticipated and refused in the work of the artists I discuss here. That fact is barely recognized in mainstream art criticism, which tends to reject work once it detects the presence of an identity and a discernible politics.29” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) ~~直白是艺术评论的软肋，这恰恰是这些艺术家尝试去攻克的。很有意思的是似乎杜尚带领现代艺术进入了某种观念性的时代，但现在我们需要的其实是解构这种观念的霸权。  ~~
  
~~但我的问题恰恰也来源于此：**_到底什么情况下，直白是可取的，什么情况下它只是可悲的缺乏想象力的照搬说教？~~_**

[^music]:“Music responds to the terror of noise, recreating differences between sounds and repressing the tragic dimension of lasting dissonance—just as sacrifice responds to the terror of violence. Music has been, from its origin, a simulacrum of the monopolization of the power to kill, a simulacrum of ritual murder.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22) ~~乐理里本身就会把声音分成乐音和噪音，这种二分法就像你是英勇牺牲的还是在恐怖主义袭击中自杀的一样，是被某种音乐的审美所控制的。~~

“The affective density of the works discussed in this book may be understood as one way of working with noise, in which case affect appears as an interference, as a rupture in which the viewer is thrown back onto, into a disoriented self. That noise feels like the other side of art.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22) 这本书里讨论的艺术可能就像噪音艺术一样。

“When you are shocked by art, you usually don’t think, Wow, that’s great art! but What was that?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22) 这是一个不错的简单粗暴的标准——你会皱起眉头的艺术一般至少是会挑战你的艺术。

“Many of the principal figures in these new styles come from groups traditionally marginalized, who are defined by the mainstream as noise anyway, and who thus have been in particularly good positions to observe the oppressive nature of the reigning order. . . . All are people who managed not to be silenced by the institutional framework” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22)

[^comfort]:“Traditionally, when critics identify an artwork as difficult, it is because a full understanding of its importance requires specific training in the art historical developments that precede it in order to recognize the work’s dialogue with art history and with museum culture. Art’s difficulty in those instances grows from its engagement with genre, with its material context.34 The difficulty of noisy works belongs to a different order. Critical efforts to access this dimension of artistic practices make some art historians nervous precisely because such work requires a turn against the discipline (a “looking away”), at least until that discipline is reconfigured (in which case, this noise will transform itself again).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 23) ~~the "difficult art" for general public might be exactly the comfort zone for art historian, whereas the "difficult art" for art historian might be something that they can't conclude with their pre-existing contemporary art context.~~

“A work’s difficulty might be institutional (in the material history of its development, and suppression and the absence of an apparatus or network invested in supporting it either with an exhibition or in critical treatment); it might be historical (in that the work’s site of intervention is not Art as institution and discipline but History); and it might also be affective (in which the spectator is confronted with and enlisted in a powerful and often disturbing set of emotions).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 23)

“Athey’s audience is not asked to look at the artist’s body but to keep company with it and to sit with their feelings about doing so. For many, that experience is revelatory.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 24)

“He freely admitted, however, that whereas the performance might be “cathartic” for some, it might hold for others “a certain sideshow appeal.” Some might even find it “burlesque.”38” (Doyle, 2013, p. 27)

“As my friend watched Richard White sew the limes into Athey’s skin, she thought, “Is this really happening?” Another friend who was also at Sin-a-matic that night remembers that it changed her life even though at the sight of so much blood she (like quite a few other audience members) passed out.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 27)

“you adjust and accommodate to what’s happening and also to the flexibility of your own desire. If you can’t, you look away or you leave. These are portraits of the people who stayed.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 27) 能够在这些有挑战性的表演里留下来的人，是能够适应眼前发生的事情， 并且适时的调整自己预期的人。
