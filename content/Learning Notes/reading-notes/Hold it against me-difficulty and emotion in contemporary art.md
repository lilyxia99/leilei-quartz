## Review

### The more intimate, the more difficult

The author missed a performance of Adrian Howells, and The author's seek to care and forgiveness is not to make Howell feel better, but **to make the author feel better**. It also becomes part of the work of "Held"--as Adrian Howells's work is about intimacy and care-taking. 

Probably out of an attempt to make themselves feel better, started to think maybe they are subconsciously trying to avoid this "hard performance", and started thinking of how this seemingly tender and intimate performance could be challenging. It's the emotion, they argued, that is more challenging than blood or nudity. 

The blood and attack might not be even more challenging than intimacy. Intimacy, care and trust is what's even more dangerous. The more tactile is the more intrusive, the more spectacle could be the more detached.

情感会让一个作品对某一个人来说变得容易，对另一个人来说变得很难吗？当然会的吧，这都是因为我们太在意其他人的看法了。情感里的一部分或许就是来自于人际关系。 It's more provoking when an artworks stimulates feeling rather than just letting it plainly flows. Facing this kind of works, critic could be very biased  and even frightened, because it's uncool to be "moved". Taste is not only about the appreciation of art. It's essentially inter-personal relationships, and both are so at stake for critics:

>it can be hard to have intense feelings in museums when those feelings go against social protocol. In an art gallery, anger, tears, arousal, and certain kinds of laughter may appear to signal the disintegration of composure, **naïveté, and a lack of class**. In such spaces, as much as we are encouraged to be moved by works of art, we are also encouraged to **remain cool.**..The museum as a whole, as an ideological home, does not welcome us equally.

Adrian Howells is challenging in its contradictory intimacy and publicness. 明明家庭是一个温馨私密的空间，但是在美术馆里却变成了一种奇怪的混合产物——一方面它在构造这种真诚的互动，另一方面它是一种展示.[^family]  这种又公共又亲密的体验是一种**extimate**，某种意义上约炮或者搭子是否也是这样？艺术家或者观众在这里变成了如同性工作者一样的存在，然而性工作者的行为本身就是被边缘化的。

另一方面让这样的体验变得艰难的，是面对亲密离开时候的感伤。我们都知道这是**灰姑娘的水晶鞋**，过了十二点就会消失。我们享受着虚假的幸福，但是在真实的痛楚来临之时变得格外悲伤。 因为我们依赖的是一种外界的给予，而非我们自身的力量和勇气吧。如果存在和非存在都是持续存在，而非二元对立的时候，这种分离的焦虑是不是就会消失呢？

The author mentions that people have a far higher standard for contemporary artworks than films. It's okay to be shocked, grossed, moved by films, but rare and uncomfortable if you feel the same in a gallery. 例如拉斯冯提尔的作品就是非常“难看”，但是不妨他依旧混得风生水起。Maggie Nelson 评价拉斯冯提尔的作品是不可原谅而且自我正当化的。拉斯冯提尔的电影出名，并非是出自别的事情，而**正是因为它的残酷**。_它把 "事情的真相 "说成是现实主义，说成是真知灼见，而实际上却是纯粹的意识形态。_ 单纯地呈现恶，在揭露的同时，也在将其**正当化，平凡化，景观化，更加地常态化**。[^cruel]

### To argue for literalness

>There’s so much art out there that doesn’t read. The information is so oblique that you can’t get it unless there’s a library next to it.

this is so true. there r so many works that relies on the wall text instead of its actual affect, and it turns into an insider work of which the significance can only be understood by people who are familiar with art history. 很多艺术制造某种只有小圈子才能get到的黑话和玩笑。Art criticism has formed a solid bias--difficulty to understand = information not available. = cool = anti-emotional. 这种不可解读性被直接售卖为艺术[^opacity]  这种不透明性只是在铸造新的长城，维护一种等级化的，不是inaccessible 的品味。这是国家文化能力的象征——既然是高品位，必须是精英 ，怎能是这么直白好懂的？

在当代艺术圈里，似乎==某种直白的表达是不被待见的==。有时候人们不会直说这个作品的争议，而是会去说这个作品==天真，直白，没有美感==。 这听上去像是我在说的事情……这么一想，实际上虽然我不喜欢那件在墙上写男女骂人标语的作品，但实际上它确认展现了一些东西，同时也引发了人们的思考。这是人们不愿意面对的暴力。言之有物总比空洞的比喻要好。

当然，政治审查在这里面也是有见解影响的。90年代的时候，NEA 赞助的资金不会赞助描写同性恋或者可能冒犯宗教观众的作品。虽然现在不是这样，但是这确实也产生了一些影响。[^90s] As an example of how government and institutional machine could see artworks as extra-difficult, the author mentions Ricardo Dominguez, who was accused by his artworks of helping immigrant to get water in desert. [^Ricardo Dominguez] _在墨西哥和美国边境地区的'死亡季节'将水藏起来，作为一种类似的自发释放行为--不是作为一种政治声明（或者不仅仅是政治声明），而是作为一种身体反射，作为一种直观的伦理姿态，坚持'不要在我的眼皮底下_ 。[^feeding action]母亲的身体是死的，但是喂养的动作却如同处于本能一样，在边境储水本身是一种对于生存的直觉反应——不管你跨越边境是否到的，既然你在这儿了，我**不容你在我眼皮底下受难而没有尊严地死去**。虽然本身这个行为高度政治性，但是实际想想，这是一种充满了情感的动作。[^mother]  

### 争议和时代

而这一发现似乎也得益于像Beck这样的保守派的"close reading"。如果我们仅仅以我们的视角去控诉不理解的人怎么怎么保守和顽固不化，*我们永远没有办法真正地去讨论这个作品。我们会不断地抱怨大环境，但实际上可能是黑子才会对作品才“真正地”仔细研究过。* 他们吹毛求疵，正是因为他们用显微镜看每一个可以被攻击的点。他们对作品的关注可能甚至大过对作品吹捧，但是只是泛泛地欢迎**样板戏**的人。[^haters] 如果仅仅是talk over each other，不论是正方还是反方，都抑制了我们讨论作品本身的可能性。正方只会不断地责备大环境的不好，就像认为《大雨》《姜子牙》难看就是一盖帽审查。所以==sit with your enemy, you will find more about yourself==. 

为什么艺术这么容易引起争议和拒绝呢？艺术界希望艺术像科学一样“改变生活”（tool本身就永远是改变生活的东西，否则无法称之为tool）另一方面希望艺术能够真的改变社会秩序和不平等，让大家自我感觉良好。作者认为，如果能做到这一点，那往往它一定是个革命性的。或许这是因为当它真实地解决了一些问题的时候，它就必然是政治性的，而政治性往往会触动某些人的奶酪。[^solve] 运动的受伤风险恐怕比艺术的风险要大得多，但是如果停止体育赛事是粉丝们不会同意的。艺术的争议比体育更大，因为在艺术里，观众冒的风险除了“感受”，别无其它——或者至少这是一个预期。[^sports] 

>The legislative marks against federal support of overtly political art has been echoed by art critics who ==**dismiss overtly political work as naïve, literalist forms of propaganda**== disengaged from aesthetics and art history....Emotion, especially when coupled with a ==legible politics==, appears as critically indigestible matter, a roadblock to “serious” criticism (Doyle, 2013, p. 12)

damn，这不就是我吗。我就挺不喜欢很直白的政治作品的。对我来说这有一种哗众取宠的感觉。如果是可以被解读的政治作品，就是无聊的，就是literal的，就是没有严肃叙事的。[^boring] 

面对有争议的作品，仅仅是拒绝并不是一种有效率的讨论方式——**拒绝包含了全盘转向和全盘接受**。事实上，即便这种争议令我们沮丧，==这种沮丧和拒绝的态度也inform 了我们是谁==。 [^informed]  Dominguez的作品不仅仅是作品本身，也包括外界的反应以及艺术家本身的持续维护，让这个作品继续生存下去。[^survive] 对于这个作品来说，争议是计划中的一部分。即便是转头不去看，你也是受到了这个作品的影响——你被刺激去look away。或许是彻底的无视才是最糟糕的。厌恶或者是喜欢都是一个作品成功的标志。[^lookAway]

但是对于很多其他艺术家来说，争议一般是具有伤害性的。[^contraversy] 争议最终是一种转移注意力，是一种极致的简化。我们讨论的“困难”不是作品本身的困难，而是the difficulties for us to 直面这些困难。Athey的表演因为它用血的桥段被污蔑而引起争议性，这种争议里面存在诸多媒体的误解和信息暴力。民众和媒体不会关心这个表演其实完全和政府资金没啥关系，只用了200刀的小赞助。即便是用了20刀，即便艺术家本人从来没有申请过类似的奖项，这也是一个“政府资助”的项目。[^Athey] 

>[!note]
>但是being literal是不是有一些不同的spectrum呢？我感觉也有一些不同程度的being literal。或许我不太喜欢那种像拉斯冯提尔式的literal——揭示了暴力，但似乎只是变成了一种**暴露疗法**。[^1] 是不是也不能直接就把hard and difficult art 和有意义划等号？感觉作者对于现代艺术作品就有一些格外的关照，当ta在讨论电影的时候可不是这样的。  当然，可能可以argue对于像战争片，科幻灾难片之类的作品，这种痛苦是作为一种娱乐和消费品。但难道在当代艺术中不是的吗？还是说因为它没有提供一个happy ending，所以它并不是一种廉价的景观了？

### Limitation of art critic

>I argue that the literalism attributed by some art historians and critics to certain kinds of work (engaged with questions of history, identity, and identification and almost always by artists of color, feminists, and queer artists) reflects a critical limit, and not a limit to the work itself. 

critical distance似乎是一个评论家很看重的东西, and the "difficult art" for general public might be exactly the comfort zone for art historian, whereas the "difficult art" for art historian might be something that they can't conclude with their pre-existing contemporary art context--==the emotional, marginal, underground art==.[^comfort] 

很有意思的是似乎杜尚带领现代艺术进入了某种观念性的时代，但现在我们需要的其实是解构这种观念的霸权。  [^Direct] 但我的问题恰恰也来源于此：_到底什么情况下，直白是可取的，什么情况下它只是可悲的缺乏想象力的照搬说教？

乐理里本身就会把声音分成乐音和噪音，这种二分法就像你是英勇牺牲的还是在恐怖主义袭击中自杀的一样，是被某种音乐的审美所控制的。[^music] 

## Annotations  
(1/28/2024, 4:39:47 PM)

“Critics can be tone deaf; we can miss the pleasures others take, ignore the irritation that others feel. We can be willful and stubborn, blind to the dwindling relevance of those artists we love and indifferent to the emergence of new practices we don’t understand.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 1) ~~critic could be very biased~~

“Howells’s work maximizes the possibilities of what he describes as “accelerated intimacy.” He has explored the contours of confession and autobiography in performances that rehearse the most painful and embarrassing moments in his history for small audiences, and sometimes audiences of one.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 2)

“Apparently I couldn’t inhabit the structure of that encounter without being overwhelmed—by what, though?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 3) 

“What happens at the end of the appointment? I was attracted enough to the idea to schedule the appointment but disturbed enough that I made it impossible for me to honor it. In doing so, I subconsciously preempted the betrayal I expected, for the experience of Held would feel either very empty and disappointing or very full and disappointing. I had reacted badly to what Jon Cairns describes as the “confusing context of ‘staged’ intimacy” in which Howells works.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 3)

“by trekking down there anyway to solicit his forgiveness, I managed to extract the caretaking that Howells offered within the boundaries of Held but outside the boundaries of the event. I insisted on getting what I thought the artist had promised me, but on my own terms, and after blowing him off. (Of course, behind this self-analysis are years of therapy. The responsibility to each other’s time is one of the first things one works through with an analyst, especially if one has missed an appointment or is habitually late.)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 3) ~~Howells's work is about intimacy and care-taking while the fact that the author was late and still seek that care and forgiveness, is not to make Howell feel better, but **to make the author feel better**. It also becomes part of the work of "Held"~~

“I was cavalier about my own limits and dismissive of others’, as if it were a moral failing to be averse to the sight of blood or be uncomfortable with the idea of live performances engaging in acts that look (and sometimes are) sexual. Howells showed me how deluded I’d been: the mere idea of certain kinds of performance provoked in me a defensive need to assert control over my place in the picture. As a spectator to performance art, I might have a high tolerance for blood, nudity, and noise, but I seem to have a lower tolerance for work engaged with more ordinary forms of relational intimacy, for the things that “feel” like life and therefore cut too close.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 4) ~~The blood and attack might not be even more challenging than intimacy. Intimacy, care and trust is what's even more dangerous. The more tactile is the more intrusive, the more spectacle could be the more detached.~~

“Emotion can make our experience of art harder, but it also makes that experience more interesting. It may make things harder because the work provokes unpleasant or painful feelings.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 4) ~~It's more provoking when an artworks stimulates feeling rather than just letting it plainly flows~~.

“For all the ways that emotion animates the way we talk about art—being “carried away” or “moved” by the beauty of a painting, for example—it can be hard to have intense feelings in museums when those feelings go against social protocol. In an art gallery, anger, tears, arousal, and certain kinds of laughter may appear to signal the disintegration of composure, naïveté, and a lack of class. In such spaces, as much as we are encouraged to be moved by works of art, we are also encouraged to remain cool” (Doyle, 2013, p. 4)

“questions of aesthetic judgment are questions of taste and that they are historically and socially conditioned.2 They reflect and reproduce the values of a class. What you enjoy, how you enjoy it, and how you express that enjoyment can reveal a lot about who you are and where you come from” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5) ~~Taste is not only about the appreciation of art. It's essentially inter-personal relationships~~.

“Many find themselves at odds with a world in which appearing to be cool and aloof is the mark of sophistication.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5) 确实，在美术馆里保持高冷才会受到尊敬，即便是喜欢的作品也得表现地卓尔不群。 ^68aab3

“The museum as a whole, as an ideological home, does not welcome us equally.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5)

“As critics, what are our responsibilities toward work that quite literally takes us out of our comfort zone, and toward the audiences who seek out these experiences?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 5)

“I thought of a sentimental pop song as like a sentimental novel or film, as if sentimentality were a thing in and of itself, which a text might embody and communicate.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6)

“The coziness of the domestic space is a lure; as any student of sentimental fiction knows, homes are haunted. Howells invites his audience into a queer space of intimacy whose edges are shaped by failure and isolation. (What domestic scene isn’t?)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) _家庭空间的温馨是一种诱惑；任何一个研究情感小说的人都知道，家是闹鬼的地方。豪厄尔斯邀请他的读者进入一个由失败和孤独塑造边缘的同性恋亲密空间。(哪个家庭场景不是如此呢？）_

“this home were a bordello offering not the sexual excitement of the mistress but the grounding companionship of the wife.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6)

[^family]:“how overdetermined that scene of domestic intimacy is for many of us. Cairns therefore describes the artist as practicing an ambivalent form of intimacy—a fundamentally queer occupation of domestic, personal, feminine, and reproductive scenes in which sites associated with privacy and safety become instead scenes of exposure” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) ~~明明家庭是一个温馨私密的空间，但是在美术馆里却变成了一种奇怪的混合产物——一方面它在构造这种真诚的互动，另一方面它是一种展示~~

“Lauren Berlant describes these kinds of spaces as “intimate publics”; Tavia Nyong’o uses the term extimate to suggest how they can fail, leaving us feeling more alone than ever.5” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) ~~这种又公共又亲密的体验是一种extimate，某种意义上约炮或者搭子是否也是这样？  
我们都知道这是灰姑娘的水晶鞋，过了十二点就会消失。我们享受着虚假的幸福，但是在真实的痛楚来临之时变得格外悲伤。  ~~
  
~~因为我们依赖的是一种外界的给予，而非我们自身的力量和勇气吧。如果存在和非存在都是持续存在，而非二元对立的时候，这种分离的焦虑是不是就会消失呢？~~

“what makes a work hard for one person and easy for another.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 6) ~~情感会让一个作品对某一个人来说变得容易，对另一个人来说变得很难吗？当然会的吧，这都是因为我们太在意其他人的看法了。情感里的一部分或许就是来自于人际关系。~~

“one might ask why we are prepared to accept the value of feeling bad when we read a novel, for example, but are less prepared to do so when we go to a museum. Why is it easier for us to watch an upsetting movie than it is to keep company with contemporary art that makes similar emotional demands on us? Why should the idea of attending Howells’s performance be more unsettling than sitting through a movie like Secrets and Lies (1996) or Steel Magnolias (1989)?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 7) Is that true? is that true that we are less prepared to be disappointed by contemporary art? I don't think so.

“Maggie Nelson describes that director’s cruelty as both unforgiving and self-righteous:” (Doyle, 2013, p. 7) ~~Maggie Nelson 评价拉斯冯提尔的作品是不可原谅而且自我正当化的。~~

[^cruel]:“Thus this kind of work accrues cultural value not in spite of its cruelty but because of it: it rationalizes the brutality of the status quo. It presents “the way things are” as realism, as insight, when in fact it is pure ideology.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~拉斯冯提尔的电影出名，并非是出自别的事情，而正是因为它的残酷。_它把 "事情的真相 "说成是现实主义，说成是真知灼见，而实际上却是纯粹的意识形态。_ 单纯地呈现恶，在揭露的同时，也在将其正当化，平凡化，景观化，更加地常态化。~~

“Lucy Lippard expresses sympathy with a similar complaint lodged by Wojnarowicz. Writing about the contrast between the “literalness” of his work and the opacity of the work of his contemporaries, he observes, “~~There’s so much art out there that doesn’t read. The information is so oblique that you can’t get it unless there’s a library next to it.~~” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~this is so true. there r so many works that relies on the wall text instead of its actual affect.
~~
“Creating an elite in the art world, in terms of how one gets the joke or can understand the information, is no better than what happens in the larger social structure.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~制造某种只有小圈子才能get到的黑话和玩笑，只是在铸造新的长城。并没有起到艺术应有的作用。~~

“why the fear that it is uncool to show feelings on surface, to explain one’s work in the titles or captions, seems so universally internalized.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~在当代艺术圈里，似乎某种直白的表达是不被待见的。~~

“Art criticism has aligned one form of difficulty (in which a work’s meaning is not readily available to the viewer) with a regulation of affect (in which opacity, the difficulty of meaning, is packaged as cool, distanced, and antiemotional).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~art criticism has formed a solid bias--difficulty to understand = information not available. = cool = anti-emotional~~

[^opacity]: “sell this marriage of the impenetrable and the unmovable as Art” (Doyle, 2013, p. 8) ~~这种不可解读性被直接售卖为艺术。~~

[^90s]:“The moral panic of the decade led to the adoption of an antiobscenity clause in the administration of nea funding (eventually found unconstitutional) that prohibited the use of federal funding to support work that depicted homosexuality or that might offend religious viewers (for starters).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 9) ~~90年代的时候，NEA 赞助的资金不会赞助描写同性恋或者可能冒犯宗教观众的作品。虽然现在不是这样，但是这确实也产生了一些影响。~~

[^Ricardo Dominguez]:“Ricardo Dominguez. He is an electronic artist, a founding member of Electronic Disturbance Theater, and a tenured professor at University of California, San Diego. In 2010 Dominguez and his collaborators at b.a.n.g.lab came under investigation for criminal charges related to his work on “virtual sit-ins” (legal forms of electronic protest). He was also accused of misusing university resources in the development of b.a.n.g.lab’s Transborder Immigrant Tool, a mobile phone application designed to guide people crossing the Mexico-U.S. border to water caches. (Thousands have died of dehydration in making this journey.) The application also offers lines of poetry inspired by the desert’s landscape. Members of the U.S. Congress petitioned the University of California to investigate the artist for violating Section 274(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, for, in their words, “encouraging aliens to illegally enter the United States.”15” (Doyle, 2013, p. 9) Ricardo Dominguez is accused by his artworks. But this is quite different from Lars Von Tier's films, which are fictions. These are real activism, isn't it?

[^the feeding action]:“The b.a.n.g.lab artists write of the mother’s experience of the “letdown,” in which her body responds to her infant’s cry by producing milk. They ask, “What if we made the desert into such a body? . . . Imagine caching water in the Mexican-U.S. borderlands’ ‘season of dying’ as a comparable act of spontaneous release—not as a political statement (or not only that) but as a corporeal reflex, as an intuitive ethical gestus to insist, ‘not on my watch.’”16” (Doyle, 2013, p. 10) ~~_在墨西哥和美国边境地区的'死亡季节'将水藏起来，作为一种类似的自发释放行为--不是作为一种政治声明（或者不仅仅是政治声明），而是作为一种身体反射，作为一种直观的伦理姿态，坚持'不要在我的眼皮底下_  
  ~~
  
[^mother]:~~母亲的身体是死的，但是喂养的动作却如同处于本能一样，在边境储水本身是一种对于生存的直觉反应——不管你跨越边境是否到的，既然你在这儿了，我不容你在我眼皮底下受难而没有尊严地死去。这是一种充满了情感的动作。~~

[^solve]:“The Transborder Immigrant Tool hysterically embodies Art’s conflict with itself: the desire that it have the value of a science—that its impact on the world be something we can measure and demonstrate—and the desire that art make us all feel better (about ourselves and the world) by actually redressing social inequity (but not really). An object that really did do all of these things might indeed be criminal. Or revolutionary.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) ~~艺术界希望艺术像科学一样“改变生活”（tool本身就永远是改变生活的东西，否则无法称之为tool）另一方面希望艺术能够真的改变社会秩序和不平等，让大家自我感觉良好。作者认为，如果能做到这一点，那往往它一定是个革命性的。或许这是因为当它真实地解决了一些问题的时候，它就必然是政治性的，而政治性往往会触动某些人的奶酪。~~

[^survive]:“The Transborder Immigrant Tool was projected into a conflict zone. Its authors are as much new media activists as artists. (Dominguez’s work can’t be thought of as one or the other; it should be treated as both.) The work here is not limited to the object; it includes public discourse about that object and the interventions of the artists themselves in the media. (The artists continue to index the application’s use and public discourse about it and about the border.)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) ~~Dominguez的作品不仅仅是作品本身，也包括外界的反应以及艺术家本身的持续维护，让这个作品继续生存下去。~~

[^contraversy]:“The project itself was designed to fold those battles into its content. Many artists whose work becomes controversial intend no such thing. Controversy’s impact on artists who are not media activists is more often than not corrosive and unrecoverable.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) ~~对于这个作品来说，争议是计划中的一部分。但是对于很多其他艺术家来说，争议一般是具有伤害性的。~~

“One of our performance projects, titled Mapa Corpo (2004), was rejected by a dozen U.S. museums and universities when they learned the nature of the central image: a nude body covered with 40 acupuncture needles, each bearing a small flag of one of the “coalition forces.” Audience members were invited “to decolonize the body/map of the performer” by extracting a needle/flag. After so many rejections” (Doyle, 2013, p. 11) 原来美国也存在审查的问题，对于裸体和对于colonial话题的审查。不过是一个裸体上面插满了针灸针，每一根针上面有旗子嘛。说实话我感觉美国人对于这样的审查真是有点大惊小怪了，问问中国人你就知道这种审查可只是毛毛雨罢了。

[^1]:~~“The legislative marks against federal support of overtly political art has been echoed by art critics who dismiss overtly political work as naïve, literalist forms of propaganda disengaged from aesthetics and art history.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 12) damn，这不就是我吗。我就挺不喜欢很直白的政治作品的。对我来说这有一种哗众取宠的感觉。但是being literal是不是有一些不同的spectrum呢？我感觉也有一些不同程度的being literal。或许我不太喜欢那种像拉斯冯提尔式的literal——揭示了暴力，但似乎只是变成了一种**暴露疗法**。~~

[^boring]:“For such critics, when this kind of work turns to the social, it turns away from art itself. This is the affectively deadened landscape to which Lippard and Wojnarowicz gesture. ~~Emotion, especially when coupled with a legible politics, appears as critically indigestible matter, a roadblock to “serious” criticism~~.18 (How this has happened is discussed in more detail in chapter 3.)” (Doyle, 2013, p. 12) ~~如果是可以被解读的政治作品，就是无聊的，就是literal的，就是没有严肃叙事的。~~

““How far is too far?” and “When does art cross the line from avant-garde to unacceptable?”19 That is basically all that the author asks of a work that dared to engage the subject of abortion.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 12)

“was ignored in favor of a review of “shock art.” That sort of writing erases the differences between controversial practices by lumping them together in a catalogue of insult to taste and quality, as if all insults (or even all work about abortion) were alike. A genuine discussion of how diverse art practices actually work is sacrificed in favor of a sensationalist story about shock. This book aims to move past the tabloid-style headlines that limit critical engagement with hard art to the question asked of the Transborder Immigrant Tool: “Is it art, or is it a crime?”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13) 并不是所有引起人惊呼的做剖都是shock art，当然也不代表所有的惊奇都是有意义的，就像saltburn里的猎奇不见得就是有意义的猎奇，

[^haters]:“That conversation suppresses the existence of the work’s core audience: the people who actively seek it out, who follow the artist’s career and give themselves over to the work’s processes. When we take a defensive position, we tell a story about controversy and the art world or controversy and a homophobic, racist, or sexist public sphere.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13) ~~如果我们仅仅以我们的视角去控诉不理解的人怎么怎么保守和顽固不化，我们永远没有办法真正地去讨论这个作品。我们会不断地抱怨大环境，但实际上可能是黑子才会对作品才“真正地”仔细研究过。他们吹毛求疵，正是因为他们用显微镜看每一个可以被攻击的点。他们对作品的关注可能甚至大过对作品吹捧，但是只是泛泛地欢迎一种样板戏的人。~~

“Controversy’s undertow draws us away from the work, away from its community and its politics, and has us all talking about museums, galleries, and fundamentalists.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13)

[^infomed]:“The audience’s limits figure explicitly in such work, and clearly we need to think carefully about how these limits ought to inform our critical practices. The defensive critical posture we adopt in the face of controversy fails us because it does not give us room to acknowledge how much failure, refusal, and rejection inform the poetics of the works in question” (Doyle, 2013, p. 13) ~~面对有争议的作品，仅仅是拒绝并不是一种有效率的讨论方式。事实上，即便这种争议令我们沮丧，这种沮丧和拒绝的态度也inform 了我们是谁。  ~~
  
~~虽然但是，是不是也不能直接就把hard and difficult art 和有意义划等号？感觉作者对于现代艺术作品就有一些格外的关照，当ta在讨论电影的时候可不是这样的。  
  
~~当然，可能可以argue对于像战争片，科幻灾难片之类的作品，这种痛苦是作为一种娱乐和消费品。但难道在当代艺术中不是的吗？还是说因为它没有提供一个happy ending，所以它并不是一种廉价的景观了？~~

“The diverting of attention from that which is meant to compel it, i.e. the actual work on display, can at times free up a recognition that other manifestations are taking place that are often difficult to read, and which may be as significant as the designated objects on display.”20” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) 当我们想要转头不去看的时候，这种回避恰恰也说明了什么。  
  
确实，如果是下意识的回避，那么这种回避本身就对这名观众来说有意义了。但是如果说对于一个观众，它并不惊奇，却在惊奇的他同时让人觉得无可奈何和景观化呢？这是我不喜欢的类型。

[^lookAway]:“The decision to look away, Rogoff writes, can also be a decision to look around—to experience the contiguity of art with the social spaces that surround it. Rogoff calls for “expanding the parameters of what constitutes engagement with art.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) ~~即便是转头不去看，你也是受到了这个作品的影响——你被刺激去关注周围的环境。或许是彻底的无视才是最糟糕的。厌恶或者是喜欢都是一个作品成功的标志。~~

““we rarely question . . . what constitutes the listening, hearing, or seeing in and of itself,” and so our perspectives can be blind to the larger social and political resonance of the practices of artists and their publics.21” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) We can probably expand the area of experience of art to more than just within the museum space. Our individual life outside of that visit is also part of that experience.

“contemporary art criticism and art history, in that scholars who write about historical and social contexts are often accused of abandoning the work of art. Rogoff ’s strategic decision to refuse that zero-sum logic of choice (in which one either talks about the work itself or looks away, to its politics) is important to this book because much of the work I discuss is not structured by that opposition.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) one of the core position of this book is to abandon the binary of talk about the work vs. talk about the context

“Is Held the encounter between the artist and his visitor? If so, where does that encounter begin and end?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 14) 如果一个作品能产生久久的回响，说明这个作品是成功的。能被记起的时候，它的作品就在那里。

“The works of art I discuss here all exploit the watery nature of emotion; this is the primary reason it can be hard (or pointless) to stabilize their boundaries as works of art. Performance art offers a particularly rich context for exploring questions regarding the presence of emotion, audience, and event.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15)

“Many of the artists most frequently identified as controversial and shockingsuch as Jeff Koons, Vanessa Beecroft, and Santiago Sierra—don’t make work that is actually all that difficult.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15)

“How difficult can Beecroft’s work be, really, when even as we complain about its exploitative structures, reproductions of her work grace the covers of art magazines?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15) 如果一个作品受到了媒体的关注，那它会自动变成作者会口诛笔伐的对象吗？

“What do we have to say about artists who aren’t making art about Art but about the Mexico-U.S. border, about intimacy and exposure, or in response to a culture of hate and fear?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 15) challenging的作品不一定是对过去艺术传统的challenge。

“controversial and obscene in a reception history that has made it almost impossible to access the actual nature of his performances.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16) 很有意思的是CHRISTINE其实就出现在了Dallas美术馆里，但是当ta出现的时候，你似乎是觉得Dallas配不上ta。这不是一个上流社会认可的问题，这就是一个你这个场子是否能燥起来的问题。

“Reviewing Athey’s place in performance scholarship, Dominic Johnson writes, “To broach the relations between Athey and varied and often uncategorisable exiles in the hinterlands of cultural practice—such as Genesis P-Orridge, Kembra Pfahler or Johanna Went—is to ask, implicitly, why so little scholarship exists about their achievements.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16)

“In other words, Athey’s work is hard for critics to engage because it isn’t primarily in dialogue with a specific academic canon. His work may cite Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean Genet, Pierre Molinier, and Francis Bacon, but its genealogy also includes death rock, disco, s&m culture, punk, radical theater, and Pentecostal ritual. Athey’s performances developed from s&m tableaux staged at Los Angeles’s Club Fuck! and moved into theater and gallery spaces—without, however leaving behind either the ethos or the audience of his club roots.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16) 当一个作品的发源来自亚文化，它就很容易被主流遗忘和主动忽视。这让我想到wren的作品还有各种net art。

“Underground artists are underground precisely because they work off the disciplinary grid, spatially and conceptually. This is a choice artists will make and revisit throughout the arc of their development, as they continue to work outside commercial spaces or decide to find a way into them” (Doyle, 2013, p. 16)

“It was erroneously reported, by a writer who had not attended the performance, that the audience had been exposed to hiv-positive blood (Ron has lived with hiv for the past 20 years; Carlton is not positive).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 17)

“The controversy was over less than two hundred dollars of nea funding used by the Walker Center to produce the event” (Doyle, 2013, p. 17)

[^Athey]:“such attacks on public support of the arts are not about what federal funding actually does but what people imagine it might do, who and what it could support.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 19) ~~Athey的表演因为它用血的桥段被污蔑而引起争议性，这种争议里面存在诸多媒体的误解和信息暴力。民众和媒体不会关心这个表演其实完全和政府资金没啥关系，只用了200刀的小赞助。即便是用了20刀，即便艺术家本人从来没有申请过类似的奖项，这也是一个“政府资助”的项目。~~

“A lot of people get nervous about blood (giving it, the sight of it, coming into contact with it). When someone is bleeding as part of a performance, there are of course steps one takes to minimize risk of exposure. Lack of familiarity with those protocols makes the idea of blood in performance even more intimidating.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 19)

[^sports]: “The idea of shutting down the sport spectacle would strike fans as bizarre, but the controversy produced around art should strike people as even crazier,” (Doyle, 2013, p. 19) ~~运动的受伤风险恐怕比艺术的风险要大得多，但是如果停止体育赛事是粉丝们不会同意的。艺术的争议比体育更大，因为在艺术里，观众冒的风险除了“感受”，别无其它——或者至少这是一个预期。~~

“People are anxious about what is going to happen at an Athey performance—not to him, but to them. Athey developed his signature blood-work pieces in the midst of the aids crisis. The protocols of safer sex as well as the medical handling of the sick body are sometimes as much a part of his performances as are sadomasochistic practices. And the two are deeply related in his work.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20)

“But the enduring difficulty of Athey’s work is more closely tied to the way that it mixes pleasure and pain—and does so in spectacles that speak to larger social experiences of belonging and alienation, care and abandonment, hope and despair” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20) Athey的作品形成的景观，是如何对社会体验产生对话的呢？

“the things that make Athey’s performances hard for some people are not all that different from the things that make Adrian Howells’s seemingly tame performances hard for others. They are not that different from what is hard about Linda Montano’s performance video, Mitchell’s Death. These are the things that, in fact, make life hard. They are productive and important kinds of difficulty—not because they expand our ideas of what constitutes Art but because they speak to quite fundamental aspects of being a social subject” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20) 这里没懂。意思是ta的spectacle有助于让人们意识到自己这个时代的一些议题，例如血液、艾滋之类的吗？

“The controversy that surrounds Athey’s work is engineered to keep us from thinking about and working through these aspects of its difficulty. Attention to a work’s controversy actually suppresses attention to a work’s difficulty.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 20) ~~争议，不论是正方还是反方，都抑制了我们讨论作品本身的可能性。ta实际上是一种转移注意力。我们讨论的“困难”不是作品本身的困难，而是the difficulties for us to 直面这些困难。~~

“translation of difficulty into scandal, the secret of which is constructed as always already known, relieving the critic of the need to discuss it.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) 一旦争议变成丑闻，艺术评论家就不需要讨论这件事情了。

[^naiive]:“The difficulty of the artworks discussed in this book is tied to their emotional and identificatory geometries. That difficulty has been flattened by traditional critical practices. Because this kind of work is shaped by a comingling of narrative, feelings, and politics it can appear to some critics as naïve and propagandistic, especially when race and gender are on the table.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) ~~有时候人们不会直说这个作品的争议，而是会去说这个作品天真，直白，没有美感。  ~~
  
~~这听上去像是我在说的事情……这么一想，实际上虽然我不喜欢那件在墙上写男女骂人标语的作品，但实际上它确认展现了一些东西，同时也引发了人们的思考。这是人们不愿意面对的暴力。言之有物总比空洞的比喻要好。~~

[^critical]:“these “discourse-specific practices” often seek out a relationship with “the other” and risk an overidentification with the subject “othered” by the discourse these artists engage, in a collapse of critical distance” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) ~~critical distance似乎是一个评论家很看重的东西~~

“Foster worries that in such work (often autobiographical and overtly political) “an ideal practice might be projected onto the field of the other, which is then asked to reflect it as if it were not only authentically indigenous but innovatively political.”” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21)

[^Direct]:“I argue that the literalism attributed by some art historians and critics to certain kinds of work (engaged with questions of history, identity, and identification and almost always by artists of color, feminists, and queer artists) reflects a critical limit, and not a limit to the work itself. In fact that desire to read artists as having “ethnographer envy,” as so many relics and theoretical primitives, is anticipated and refused in the work of the artists I discuss here. That fact is barely recognized in mainstream art criticism, which tends to reject work once it detects the presence of an identity and a discernible politics.29” (Doyle, 2013, p. 21) ~~直白是艺术评论的软肋，这恰恰是这些艺术家尝试去攻克的。很有意思的是似乎杜尚带领现代艺术进入了某种观念性的时代，但现在我们需要的其实是解构这种观念的霸权。  ~~
  
~~但我的问题恰恰也来源于此：**_到底什么情况下，直白是可取的，什么情况下它只是可悲的缺乏想象力的照搬说教？~~_**

[^music]:“Music responds to the terror of noise, recreating differences between sounds and repressing the tragic dimension of lasting dissonance—just as sacrifice responds to the terror of violence. Music has been, from its origin, a simulacrum of the monopolization of the power to kill, a simulacrum of ritual murder.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22) ~~乐理里本身就会把声音分成乐音和噪音，这种二分法就像你是英勇牺牲的还是在恐怖主义袭击中自杀的一样，是被某种音乐的审美所控制的。~~

“The affective density of the works discussed in this book may be understood as one way of working with noise, in which case affect appears as an interference, as a rupture in which the viewer is thrown back onto, into a disoriented self. That noise feels like the other side of art.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22) 这本书里讨论的艺术可能就像噪音艺术一样。

“When you are shocked by art, you usually don’t think, Wow, that’s great art! but What was that?” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22) 这是一个不错的简单粗暴的标准——你会皱起眉头的艺术一般至少是会挑战你的艺术。

“Many of the principal figures in these new styles come from groups traditionally marginalized, who are defined by the mainstream as noise anyway, and who thus have been in particularly good positions to observe the oppressive nature of the reigning order. . . . All are people who managed not to be silenced by the institutional framework” (Doyle, 2013, p. 22)

[^comfort]:“Traditionally, when critics identify an artwork as difficult, it is because a full understanding of its importance requires specific training in the art historical developments that precede it in order to recognize the work’s dialogue with art history and with museum culture. Art’s difficulty in those instances grows from its engagement with genre, with its material context.34 The difficulty of noisy works belongs to a different order. Critical efforts to access this dimension of artistic practices make some art historians nervous precisely because such work requires a turn against the discipline (a “looking away”), at least until that discipline is reconfigured (in which case, this noise will transform itself again).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 23) ~~the "difficult art" for general public might be exactly the comfort zone for art historian, whereas the "difficult art" for art historian might be something that they can't conclude with their pre-existing contemporary art context.~~

“A work’s difficulty might be institutional (in the material history of its development, and suppression and the absence of an apparatus or network invested in supporting it either with an exhibition or in critical treatment); it might be historical (in that the work’s site of intervention is not Art as institution and discipline but History); and it might also be affective (in which the spectator is confronted with and enlisted in a powerful and often disturbing set of emotions).” (Doyle, 2013, p. 23)

“Athey’s audience is not asked to look at the artist’s body but to keep company with it and to sit with their feelings about doing so. For many, that experience is revelatory.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 24)

“He freely admitted, however, that whereas the performance might be “cathartic” for some, it might hold for others “a certain sideshow appeal.” Some might even find it “burlesque.”38” (Doyle, 2013, p. 27)

“As my friend watched Richard White sew the limes into Athey’s skin, she thought, “Is this really happening?” Another friend who was also at Sin-a-matic that night remembers that it changed her life even though at the sight of so much blood she (like quite a few other audience members) passed out.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 27)

“you adjust and accommodate to what’s happening and also to the flexibility of your own desire. If you can’t, you look away or you leave. These are portraits of the people who stayed.” (Doyle, 2013, p. 27) 能够在这些有挑战性的表演里留下来的人，是能够适应眼前发生的事情， 并且适时的调整自己预期的人。

Art critic shift from emotional to hard and verifiable. Artforms and other of its alternatives really favors the "serious" criticism. *严肃性被认为是最值得捍卫的主要价值之一，尽管在这些讨论中，除了独立于市场的影响之外，人们很少考虑这个词的含义。* 

以前在做动画的时候不觉得，但是越做fine art的东西越有一种感觉——个人的东西没有所谓的stake,不能说服别人给自己投钱。然而实际上真正普世的价值观恰恰是关于个人的东西，是这种东西打动人。否做艺术也会变成春晚的小品一样，高唱某种主义和意识形态，却忘了最重要的就是情感——不论是眼泪还是欢笑。

>Seriousness is a disciplinary and disciplining stance...... Critical thought, conversely, is assumed to displace emotion. 

While the author calls for the return to emotion, the art education is doing exactly the opposite. The critique culture and artist statement styles are cultivating us to rationalize our work instead of experience our work.[^art-education] . 

情感本身不是反历史和反政治化的。相反只有个人的才是包含了最底层历史和政治元素的 [^personal].

>Abstract art and fashion serve to remove feelings from art, to leave undisturbed the deep sleep we are falling into, where we feel nothing and nothing touches us. Let emotions belong to the theater, the art critics say. Artists can only be concerned with ideas and philosophies.......and emotion flows dangerously close to propaganda and self-indulgence.

感觉这个其实点出了很多art criticism里面的傲慢

Addictive to the dopamine hit———no emotion, because all emotion = capital suspect

Emotion does feels like propaganda—感动中国

If you feel the audience to cry, it’s just soap opera. If you really are able to engage the audience, then it would be able to really move them. 

Cringe— critical size — no allowance of cringeness, the intense fear of cringiness. 

If the audience is responding to show the emotion.

*Rebeeha*: is there such a binary between serious and emotional? Does it mean that if you are thinking of the future it’s good. 

Dean: why do I end up there? Economy is also an element 

If you are not in capitalism, you wouldn’t have this type of privilege of making art. Otherwise there art is just a kind of political tool or religion

作茧自缚，认为自己是特别的，也是一种作茧自缚。
dean在roast Sina，感觉就像袁朗在说成才一样。Sina很聪明，像吴哲一样很直白，很敢于质疑，同时也很自信，但是可能他有一种独立电影人的孤傲。

Sina会说 Main stream vs me，这样的说法。这很像很多bu de vi的电影人会说的话，which is fair. 

Dean: being able to empathize, **seeing people as complex**, is basic to our reading. It is the foundation of our reading. When you find yourself in that place, you will limit the complexity. 
When you are talking about capitalism, take it as complex as you are. 

感觉dean还是挺阿德勒的。我觉得dean

it's about making a ton of work.making way more work than she thought. Making that helps her understand how much more work people are doing. It has to be breathing, this is what I do. 这可能就是阿毛说的，艺术家其实是在展现自己的生活。

“Collaborative, participatory works can completely displace the artist’s personality from his practices.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=95&annotation=D5X3J7WK))

“Until the middle of the twentieth century, much art writing could be described as literary, as portraits of how the critic felt about the work of art. Such writing could universalize the critic’s reaction to artworks and usually ignored the social, political, and historical implications of artworks, as well as the implications of the critic’s own responses to them” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=95&annotation=CMEKYHXP)) The art writing in the past is actually more emotional.

“Even in the past decade’s endless discussions of the crisis in art criticism (in which art criticism is cast as compromised by the market and is distinguished from academic work, which one worries in turn has become almost unreadable in its density), seriousness is presumed to be one of the principal values most worth defending, although there has been little consideration in such discussions of what one means by that term, outside of an independence from market influences” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=96&annotation=KPZDJD4R)) ~~_严肃性被认为是最值得捍卫的主要价值之一，尽管在这些讨论中，除了独立于市场的影响之外，人们很少考虑这个词的含义。_~~

“Because emotion itself has been associated in art criticism with a self-indulgent and naïve practice, it has been absorbed into the category of things one ought not take seriously. The serious art critic steers clear of anything resembling “a private history, a personal history.”5” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=96&annotation=JSRNPJFB)) In art criticism emotion is considered as naïve and personal account is not taken seriously.

“Gavin Butt observes that “taking something seriously is in large part a morally sanctioned and habitually ingrained form of cultural response to something we take to be of value.”6” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=96&annotation=PDJ52BFT)) what we consider "serious" is also what we consider valuable

[^art-education]:““The piles of information smother our capacity to really feel. By imperceptible steps, art history gently drains away a painting’s sheer wordless visceral force, turning it into an occasion for intellectual debate.”” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=97&annotation=B7HFGKMI)) ~~While the author calls for the return to emotion, the art education is doing exactly the opposite.

“It smothers strong emotion and puts calm understanding in its place. It puts words to experiences that are powerful because they are felt rather than thought, and in doing so it kills them.”8” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=97&annotation=RNU8NVIE))

“Calls for a return to criticism that is serious, complex, and rigorous are indebted to the model provided by Artforum and its descendents. That means, in turn, that it is important to ask whether it makes sense to revive those particular senses of commitment, verifiability, and intellectualism.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=97&annotation=G39XRB5B)) ~~Artforms and other of its alternatives really favors the "serious" criticism.~~

[^personal]:“The rhetorical deployment of the personal and the emotional should not be assumed to be a retreat into an ahistorical, apolitical self; such explicit turns to emotion may in fact signal the politicization, the historicization of that self and of the feelings through which that self takes shape in relation to others. The blanket refusal to consider this possibility is itself a political failure, as is the pretense that a critical position can be taken independent of the author’s networks of affiliation, friendships, and mentoring relationships, and as if it were not informed by his or her points of identification, estrangement, and institutional location.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=97&annotation=67KLBMK2)) ~~情感本身不是反历史和反政治化的。相反只有个人的才是包含了最底层历史和政治元素的。

“the romantic vision of the artist whose individual suffering transcends his time and place was long ago supplanted by a model of the artist and the art world as socially, politically, and institutionally situated.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=97&annotation=GXM3NYSU)) The paradigm of artists as suffering individuals are replaced by big institution, who feature their work as scholarly and research based.

“integrating art and activism (Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz’s Three Weeks in May [1971]),” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=98&annotation=X3FBIXSD)) 有意思，这个作者一开始在提difficult work的时候似乎是in defense for socially engaged and political work的。在这里是要开始diss了吗？

“how emotional complexity is played out within a work in order to problematize the association of the emotional weight of History with particular communities of people.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=98&annotation=NNWYIQT9))

“The experience of witnessing this performance was riddled with the questions you might expect: Should we be doing this? Is he okay? It seemed to take forever for Franko to complete his walk down the aisle, and he repeated this march several times” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 75](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=100&annotation=9ERQT2KU))

“I Miss You! is a stark enactment of a fantasy about love and its allure. It is about death, but only as the threat implied by love: Love me (Come back!) or I’ll die.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=101&annotation=RPE7QJZC))

“I Miss You! is staged as the act of a desperate lover, an exploration of the aggression the lover feels toward his own body as an instrument of both desire and humiliation.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=101&annotation=49QAGHUB))

“If the performance felt punk, it was not in its aggressiveness (nudity, blood) but in the combination of the spectacle of the wounded body with the refusal of a redemptive gesture. As Tavia Nyong’o writes, punk represents “a withdrawal from the constraints of an affirmative culture”: “Punk feelings help specify a radically passive and even masochistic orientation to the world.”13 Franko B’s performances are staged as ritual but enact no salvation for either the artist or the audience. If we ask ourselves, Why would he do that to himself ?, we might also ask, Why do we open ourselves up to anyone?” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=101&annotation=ERWGHACF))

“the thing that really unsettles the critic is the work’s tenderness and sentimentality. I Miss You! is earnest.

“We do not learn a thing about his biography in these performances. They are neither autobiographical nor confessional. He says nothing and in fact does very little. These events are nevertheless supercharged with emotion. Those feelings do not come from the artist so much as they circulate through the room and around his spooky body.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=101&annotation=HKPCA9LI))

“Frye Burnham describes the abject status of emotion in discourse on contemporary art: Abstract art and fashion serve to remove feelings from art, to leave undisturbed the deep sleep we are falling into, where we feel nothing and nothing touches us. Let emotions belong to the theater, the art critics say. Artists can only be concerned with ideas and philosophies. And the real pursuits turn away from performance altogether because the very presence of the “hot” human body implies emotion, and emotion flows dangerously close to propaganda and self-indulgence.14” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=102&annotation=XSXDKKFL))

“For Greenberg, the term kitsch signaled the recycling of feeling through popular culture at the expense of the new and the authentic. Many of the works disparaged using this vocabulary (vicarious, fake, and kitsch) fit easily under sentimentality’s umbrella.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=102&annotation=5J2QIMGZ))

“Greenberg’s complaint belongs to a broad rhetorical practice in criticism, in which the author gains the moral high ground by taking a stand against sentimentality.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=102&annotation=WZWMPFHI)) 只要你说你不支持sentimentality，你就自动获得了道德制高点。

“it often wraps itself around a denunciation of political correctness, in which the artist’s good intentions override his commitment to good art.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 77](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=102&annotation=ACYIS2EZ))

“denigrate contemporary collaborative, overtly political art practices as a form of sentimental liberalism. She writes, “The discursive criteria of socially engaged art are, at present, drawn from a tacit analogy between anticapitalism and the Christian ‘good soul.’”16 She attacks collaborative art practices that indulge this Christian ethic of self-sacrifice and good works. In another article she dismisses the work of Vik Muniz and Harrell Fletcher for “generating ripples of embarrassment through the audience for their reality tv sentimentality,” a reaction she takes as synonymous with artistic failure.17” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=103&annotation=Q49UGMS3)) 好像说到如果作品很像真人秀，就是一个贬义，一场失败一样。但是真人秀有什么不好的呢？真人秀我也很喜欢啊。  
这里说到的一个很重要的问题是，确实流行文化里面会有很多emotional的成分，为了能够把自己和主流区分开来，艺术或者艺术家确实会有这种塑造“我更加冷静”的形象。不然，你和流行文化无异，但是还不能引起相同程度的共鸣，这不就显示出了你的失败吗？为了遮掩这种失败，艺术界不惜全盘否定流行文化成功的因素——真诚的情感。  
  
然而，那么就出现了问题——如果说流行文化里的情感是蛮好的，为什么要做艺术？去拍电视剧不香吗？

“Arguing in particular with Grant Kester’s writing on collaboration and “conversation” (in which artists dissolve their authority in dialogue with specific communities), Bishop writes, “In the absence of a commitment to the aesthetic, Kester’s position adds up to a familiar summary of the intellectual trends inaugurated by identity politics: respect for the other, recognition of difference, protection of fundamental liberties, and an inflexible mode of political correctness.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=103&annotation=4J7ALBFG)) 笑死，现在我指导Grant Kester的立场是怎样的了。应该是非常铁支持collaborative art的  
  
不过我不得不说，我确实觉得socially engaged art也很容易鱼龙混杂。仿佛只要组一个饭局就可以变成某种充满情感连接的活动。我觉得好的活动其实也take a certain type of person. 不是随随便便谁都可以形成这样的场域的，同时也不是看上去搞了活动它就是成功的。

“In The Return of the Real Hal Foster argues that “many artists treat conditions like desire or disease as sites for work. In this way they work horizontally, in a synchronic movement from social issue to issue, from political debate to debate, more than vertically, in a diachronic engagement with the disciplinary forms of a given medium.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=103&annotation=Q36BRHLU)) Hal Foster认为working vertically就是基于媒介的创作，working horizontally就是蹭热点。

“Art of the period has become “dangerously political,” grounded in issue and identity as the artist indulges an “over-identification with the other,” which Foster forecasts as “a murderous disidentification from the other.” “Today,” he writes, “the left overidentifies with the other as victim, which locks it into a hierarchy of suffering whereby the wretched can do little wrong. . . . The right disidentifies from the other, which it blames as victim, and exploits this disidentification to build political solidarity through fantasmatic fear and loathing. Faced with this impasse, critical distance might not be such a bad idea at all.”20 Critical handwringing over the plight of the other is upstaged here by critical handwringing over identification with the other.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=103&annotation=CMYSQCT5)) 其实这个老哥说得虽然非常over generalized，但是有一定道理的啊。特别是在广州的社群运营就有这样的问题，这个让我想到逸群之前说的浮萍定海大家比惨，最后没有人来解决问题的状态。只要你看起来最弱，你就有最强的优势，这最后会引导到道德绑架。  
但是同理的，强者的思路一样不可取。不能因为弱者为王不对，就认为弱者应当服从和顺应环境。从这一点来讲，小河不认同其他人的做法，但是不强迫他人加入，是否就是一种尊重？但或许一部分人的“变强”本身也是带有政治性的，是意味着对其他人的排挤？  
但是即便两边存在这样的问题，这也并不能论证political distance就是合理的吧？并不是做一个理中客就能解决所有问题的。理中客也是一种立场，甚至带有一点懦弱的立场。一个带有强烈政治观点的作品并不代表它fail to be comprehensive or whatsoever.

“Baldwin works with terms and assumptions important to our conversation; namely, he presents sentimentality as a (bad) form of sadism, one ultimately complicit with the racist structures it purports to fight. He dismisses Stowe as a “pamphleteer.” He calls Uncle Tom’s Cabin “a very bad novel” and compares its “virtuous sentimentalism” with Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. The comparison needs no explanation, as, within the logic of the essay, the literary abjection of popular sentimental novels is treated as a given.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=104&annotation=PIVDA5EP)) 在类似Baldwin这样的critic眼里，sentimental是原罪

“he proceeds, “Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel; the wet eyes of the sentimentalist betray his aversion to experience, his fear of life, his arid heart; and it is always, therefore, the signal of secret and violent inhumanity, the mask of cruelty. Uncle Tom’s Cabin, like its multitudinous hard-boiled descendants, is a catalogue of violence.”21” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=104&annotation=2885CLDK))

“There is good reason for critical suspicion of sentimental practice: not only can such work package vicarious experiences of suffering as an enlightened form of entertainment, as Lauren Berlant explains in her writing on the subject, but the desire to make readers “feel right” (as Stowe herself once put it) can also look a lot like a desire for a world in which we all feel the same.2” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=104&annotation=GKIUZLVB)) 确实，sentimental的作品有变成麻醉剂和娱乐的风险。当感情变成某种滥情和公式，公式化的感动只会变成某种宣泄，吐在街上以便继续problematic的生活。这和很多励志剧的感觉有点类似

“it frequently belies the complexity of the politics of feeling and identification, and it sometimes masks the critic’s position, creating the illusion that she stands entirely outside the emotional economy she denounces. More problematically, it can support a critical practice that assumes that the problem is feeling, in and of itself, because in art feelings are always either not real or vicarious. (How many times have you seen an artist’s, filmmaker’s, or writer’s lack of sentimentality cited as praise, as if the value of this were self-evident?)” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=105&annotation=FN7SIGMK))

“The anchoring point for a modern critique of the sentimental, she observes, is the identification of a “tacitness and nonaccountability of the identification between sufferer and sentimental spectator.”24 Threaded through such critical discourse are contradictory strands of thinking about art and emotion; it implicitly calls to mind the idea of an art form that does not depend on vicarious experience (for it is often vicariousness itself which the critic presents as the problem), while also banishing the juicy, nervous, and unpredictable dimensions of feeling triggered by proximity—especially where such proximity occasions empathy or identification.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=105&annotation=YIX4626D)) 艺术评论会提倡一种不使用代入体验的作品

“The only solution offered by such rhetoric is the privileging of an anaesthetized version of the aesthetic encounter, from which the feeling body is banished. (On this point, I am tempted to see in Eakins’s The Gross Clinic a sadistic emblem for the practice of criticism.)” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=105&annotation=Y3N9GLQ5))

“Sedgwick observes that when we say something is sentimental, we describe a quality that pertains not to the text itself but to the reader’s or viewer’s relationship to it; in other words, there may be no such thing as an intrinsically sentimental text.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=105&annotation=EAHV6EW9))

“The line between good and bad art is fundamentally contingent (on class, for example) and deeply subjective.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=106&annotation=R9LJQNNB))

“Reading the Romance was part of a wave of scholarship that moved beyond the assumption that consumers of popular genres are passive dupes to dominant ideology. To gesture back to John Vincent’s work on difficulty and poetics: this kind of scholarship explores the question “What do readers want?” and also recognizes that not all readers want or need the same thing. This diversity in our investments and the text’s enormous capacity to meet our interests are, in fact, what make the whole enterprise of literature interesting.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=106&annotation=8RHTA9MZ))

“Her work is extraliterary, focused not on the text but on how it circulates. Diverse scholarslike Sedgwick, Jane Tompkins, Laura Romero, and Berlant—have spent quite a bit of time exploring how feeling can take on complex and productive dimensions in sentimental literature. The authors identified with this (porous) category were far from naïve about the textuality of their work, and sentimental writing is not always synonymous with the coercive dynamics that shaped its most celebrated (or notorious) examples.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=106&annotation=II6UBJPC))

“Rebecca Harding Davis’s “Life in the Iron Mills” quite clearly indicts its own middle-class readers who feel sympathy for the story’s characters and do nothing regarding their real-world counterparts except read about them.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=107&annotation=X3EM5ZIT))

“Although the story has many of the hallmarks of the sentimental narrative, it is also acutely wary of the feelings it puts into circulation. Sentimental literature, in other words, is diverse, and a surprising amount of it is ambivalent about sentimentality itself” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=107&annotation=FS5A3S8W)) 多愁善感的文学并不仅仅是吸食读者的情感，也会批评和关注这种情感本身。  
  
感觉作者或许觉得ambivalent 是一种更高的virtue

“Berlant uses the term countersentimental to describe texts that are “lacerated by ambivalence” and “withdraw from the contract that presumes consent with the conventionally desired outcomes of identification and compassion.”28 These works manifest a commitment to the transformative effects of emotion but also resist the universalizing imperative of sentimental traditions that use emotion to negate difference with the assumption that we all ought to feel the same. Countersentimental works explore the possibilities of feeling differently.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=107&annotation=ESUUC28I)) countersentimental的作品是反对廉价的共情

“Tears are suspect, whether they are represented within a work of art or produced in the spectator. Tears seem to embody both the height of unquestioned emotionality and the depths of emotional manipulation.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=109&annotation=NCVENCJ4))

““Over a year I wore the crying glasses while traveling on public transport in all the cities I visited. The glasses functioned using a pump system which, hidden inside my jacket, allowed me to pump water up and out of the glasses and produce a trickle of tears down my cheeks. The glasses were conceived as a tool to enable the representation of feelings in public spaces. Over the months of wearing glasses they became an external mechanism which enabled the manifestation of internal and unidentifiable emotions.”” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=109&annotation=3NXQQG6Q))

“Once emotion is absorbed into the sphere of representation, once a feeling becomes an image of feeling, its claim to authenticity (to being a real feeling) is thrown into question. Furthermore, the work mischievously implies that the disciplinary protocols of art history demand not sincerity from the artist (“real tears”) but ironical distance. And so Newman offers a counterfeit version of that.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=110&annotation=N4RGD7S8)) _艺术史的学科规程要求的不是艺术家的真诚（"真实的眼泪"），而是讽刺性的距离。_  
  
  
有时候我在想，这种ironic distance或许是一种保护机制，就像说脱口秀一样。但是即便是说笑，其实也是有真心在里面的。当你没有付出真心，你是感觉得不到痛，也就感觉不到爽的。

“The act of eating the onion begins as a perversely masochistic variant of using an onion to shed artificial tears—an external provocation to cry over a life not interesting enough to cry about. As the loop of complaints repeats itself, we watch her struggle over her own instinct as she takes one large bite from the onion after another. We hear her moan and whimper as she chokes it back, skin and all. (This aspect of the performance is almost erotic.) Over time she disintegrates before our eyes: her composed face collapses in abjection and grief.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=110&annotation=PK2Q3L5K)) 虽然是为了没有那么悲怆或者有意思的人生而哭泣，但是在吃着洋葱，流出一些人工的泪水的过程中，它逐渐也变得悲壮了起来——我们生活的无趣，和我们情感的矫揉，反而让我们的人生显得无聊得可悲。

“While at first the subject of the performance appears to be the artist’s inability to feel, to care, to cry, as she gets deeper into the onion and is more and more overcome by the difficulty of eating it, her upset appears more and more authentic. In the end, it is not the authenticity of her tears that you question but their artificiality, in part because as you watch this video it is hard not to have a physical reaction in sympathy with the manifest difficulty of eating a raw onion while suppressing the impulse to gag. Importantly, the performance anticipates and interrupts the first question we usually ask of representations of crying: “Are those tears real?” Here what starts as a theatrical production of artificial tears appears to morph into real tears over the artificiality of the performance of her daily life.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=111&annotation=SRNW3L8H)) _表演预示并打断了我们通常对哭泣的表现形式提出的第一个问题："那些眼泪是真的吗？"那些眼泪是真的吗？" 在这里，一开始是戏剧性的人工泪水表演，随着她日常生活表演的人工化，似乎变成了真实的泪水。_

“At the same point in the film’s last scene, she starts to cry. When that scene ends, she rewinds and indulges in the same tears. She does it again. And again and again. The monitor is shrouded in domestic ornaments and grandmotherly doilies—not genteel white lace but a riot of garish orange and yellow.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=111&annotation=MDYVFM9U))

“At the heart of Neapolitan is a scene of indulgence, the treat of a weepie. The installation is full of pleasure and care; we see this in the artist’s obvious affection for the film and the loving hand applied to the installation itself, in which the television becomes a homey shrine.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=111&annotation=4A55SUKV))

“she expected that as she watched this scene over and over again, the tears would eventually stop flowing. But they didn’t. The eleven-minute loop of the artist sobbing, making herself cry, is powerful and funny. She cries but doesn’t seem (to me, anyway) unhappy. Neapolitan is oddly moving in its revelation of the momentum that tears have on their own, spilling over from the contrived scene of melodramatic spectatorship to suggest a self-sustained cycle, in which tears make more tears, in which tears migrate from screen to face and back again. This, the work reminds us, is what we want from melodrama.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=112&annotation=9NMZ6H9C)) 这个作品真的很尼玛真实，这种看剧的状态不就是我本人？就是为了哭泣而看，同时一遍遍去虐去看。 这种哭泣是感动而发泄的，是爽的……

“his sadness is cited as the very thing in the way of explanation, and so it registers as expression itself.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 87](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=112&annotation=YJR4EILX))

“We are ready to accept his tears as real, in part because there is a tradition of sad, melancholy white male artists that supports this response, a tradition Ader deliberately and ironically engages.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=113&annotation=HY6SRRPL))

“As we look at a broader range of work in which crying figures centrally, we see that how we read emotion, and how emotion circulates, depends very much on the location and identity of the bodies shedding the tears. The emotionality of women is always already suspect, always already visible as performance, as imitative. Ader is a genius; the women are either acting or hysterics, or both.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=114&annotation=T7DSX5MW)) 女人的哭泣被看作是娇弱造作，看作是一种演出或者一种让人厌烦的动作。Ader，作为一个男性的哭泣，却被认为是天才的。这是否是某种“男儿有泪不轻弹”带来的福利？

“At this point, we should pause and consider the relational nature of emotion and its association with gendered forms of labor.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=114&annotation=H6MEQ3GX))

“His signature installations reproduce, in gallery settings, the exploitation of day laborers (by, for example, paying undocumented workers to sit in boxes). The audience’s relationship to those forms of exploitation is his subject. How can you judge Sierra for deploying underprivileged workers when much more violent forms of exploitation produce daily life as you know it? When you accept such relationships every time you buy a cup of coffee, drive to work, or put on your shoes?” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 90](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=115&annotation=4KQ9FCI7))

“the feelings of those deployed in Sierra’s performances are not only irrelevant to the business of art, they have in fact been irrelevant to the practice of criticism.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 90](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=115&annotation=6NKLG9Q8))

“The emotional economy of Sierra’s installations exploits the overdetermined place of affective labor in the art world. This is what many of the people around artists do for a living: they work in a service industry, educating, writing, selling. The receptionist, the bartender at an opening, and the person parking cars all provide services that have an affective dimension, as do curators, critics, and teachers. This is what artists do as well; their work makes people feel good, smart, or important (for example). Work based in process or collaboration, work that presents itself as a service explicitly positions itself in relation to the affective labor already present in the production of the art experience.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=116&annotation=9BGWTD2T))

“Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri argue that labor which revolves around the production of affect can be particularly alienating, for in this case we are alienated not merely from our time (as is the wage laborer) or from the product of our labor (as is the factory worker) but from our very emotional selves. They write, “When affective production becomes part of waged labor it can be experienced as extremely alienating: I am selling my ability to make human relationships, something extremely intimate, at the command of a client or boss.”” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=116&annotation=E2KSY3D4)) 情感劳动，说得狠一点，和性工作者无异。销售、教育都是这种出卖关系的劳动。你需要提供给人情感支持，但这也带来了你自己情感的异化——因为你要收钱。

“The professionalization of affect is especially hard on those working at the margins of economic survival—life is hard enough without health care, job security, affordable housing, and transportation—but to have to produce the spectacle of a woman at peace with the world and her position in it while working at the very job that fails to pay a living wage or provide health insurance can be too much.39 She is nevertheless expected to smile through it (“Welcome to Walmart!”).” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 91](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=116&annotation=7WYTXIA5))

“What makes Sierra’s installations challenging is not the demand that we keep company with manual labor but the awkwardness of keeping company with people who so powerfully make visible the economies of class exploitation that structure our experiences of labor and that draw the line between what kinds of work are valuable and what kinds of work are not. Sierra’s installations work as long as no one thinks of his workers as artists, and this is, perhaps, his point.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=117&annotation=7E2GIMBZ)) Sierra的作品要求我们正视这样被我们默许的劳动剥削。当这样的劳动关系被摆在台面上，我们都感觉不舒服。这就是它的目的。

“The ultimate rhetorical aim of such a critical practice is the acquisition of a moral high ground from which one can arbitrate the distinction between modes of experience that are merely entertaining or merely representative and modes of experience that are critical and also have some sort of aesthetic value (thus Foster’s call for “critical distance” at the conclusion of The Return of the Real as an antidote to the “ethnographic impulse”)” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=118&annotation=32WNN2EZ))

“Hardt and Negri help us to see that the important thing here is not the arbitration of which forms of relationality are best, which have more ethical or aesthetic integrity, but that this conversation is being staged around these terms at all. The fact that relationality itself has become the battleground for arguing the meaning and value of contemporary art confirms these global shifts regarding how people and the work they do are valued. Alarmingly, some of the criticism in this area mirrors the hierarchical logics of this service economy, in which the feelings of some communities (Sierra’s audience) outweigh those of others (his workers) and in which the emotional register attributed to the work of some artists (Sierra, Thomas Hirschhorn) is valued as more complex, as having more integrity and intelligence than the emotional register of the work of other artists (invariably, women artists and artists of color). The same classifications map onto audiences too.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=118&annotation=BSDTFGM7))

“Their protest registers the offensiveness of the idea that they would not be aware of this difference and that they would be so economically vulnerable as to not care. These workers were aware, in other words, that service work is different and, in that setting, much more valuable than manual labor. It is hard to name their anger as a part of Sierra’s work, as that anger seems to have been the very thing that brought the piece to an end and forced the art to walk out the door.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=118&annotation=86A6QC8P))

“it forced into the light the intensity with which the emotional lives of the exploited are policed and negated, even (or especially) in art that purports to be critically engaged with this exploitation.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=118&annotation=MNIH3K5G))
# Chapter4

Racial work are over simplified as 噱头

Racial works = too easy

"performing ideology" = too much emotion or anger =  critical failure

艺术评论家会觉得racial read是一种很无聊的解读，会让作品本身的experience变得扁平化。Critic wish the difficulty away

racism's foundation = visual transparency 

Luna's performance -- seemingly frustrated, 
depressive as the media
popular romance of native, native artist as artifact--the fact that they still survive

>Luna combats the depiction of Native Americans as ***existing solely in the past***, as historical figures and in the present ***only as spectral entities*.**

## Annotations

“Derek and Soraya Murray put it flatly: “Problems emerge when socially defined minorities become synonymous with the political.”1” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=119&annotation=FAXBTCSH))

“Without the detachment and autonomy of conventional art to insulate them, [these artists] are doomed to “represent” in the most naïve and facile manner possible, a given political issue or constituency. This detachment is [argued to be] necessary because art is constantly in danger of being subsumed to the condition of consumer culture or “entertainment” (cultural forms predicated on immersion rather than on recondite critical distance)” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=120&annotation=GLJF2FUW)) 为了维护艺术的某种高高在上的气质，他不能与大众娱乐“同流合污”

“Proximity, feeling, identification, and collaboration are lumped together as synonyms for each other, as complicit, “naïve and facile”—as, in other words, too easy.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=120&annotation=EB9UCAJ8)) 亲近和情感被视作“简单”。  
  
但是同时我感觉其中也有分别，也有简单的确实是简单，和简单中能够打动人，以及有想象力的简单。


“Unlike the video of 1993 (the mood of which is subdued), this performance was animated with hostility and anger. There was a palpable awkwardness in the gallery, especially as people started to leave. It went on for ages, well past the point of comfort. As time passed, he seemed to lose his place, and his talk soured. He wobbled between an anger that felt faked (and was therefore a bad performance) and that felt real (and directed at his audience). More and more people left the room.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=126&annotation=G69S88IN)) So what did he say??


“David Hammons’s installation Concerto in Black and Blue (2002). His analysis of this case is worth reproducing here, because it points to the way that the difficulty of work about race is suppressed in much art criticism, and it points to the role that affect plays in that critical failure.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=120&annotation=H3QHC3U5))

“It has a tight formalism that calls to mind the work of other artists using light as their medium, for example, James Turrell’s framing of the sky in Light Reign (2003) or Miroslaw Balka’s How It Is (2010), an enormous container that absorbs viewers in total darkness, but only as long as they have their back to the entrance.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=121&annotation=A46W6HP8))

“Concerto in Black and Blue, invokes the desire to manage the work’s difficulty by assuming a kind of transparency for it, in which the work’s meaning can be accessed by what the viewer happens to know (or think he knows) about “black art” (this is a contingent form of difficulty, dependent on what the viewer is able to recognize in the work’s references).” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=121&annotation=XPVSJE3F))

“they see it as a metaphor for blackness (as if the meaning of that term were knowable and stable) rather than as a meditation on visuality and blindness (which has everything to do with the racialist discourse through which the work is invariably experienced).5 The critic thus responds to the work literally, and with a literalism that is not even guided by the object, by what he sees. It is in fact guided by what the critic feels. That critic, English explains, scrambles to enlist on his behalf “a rhetorical triumph over the disorientations that are most elemental to the work,” as if the declaration “It’s about race” constituted some sort of meaningful insight, and as if that statement could contain the anxiety that the work provokes.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=122&annotation=DJKI89IB)) 仿佛认定这个作品和种族有关就可以对其一锤定音似的

“as long as such work appears to have something to do with discourse on race, for many critics that work represents a completely unexamined notion of Race, and its contributions to conversations about art practice are unexamined.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=122&annotation=EWWP954D))

“When Luna performs alcoholic masculine depression as The History of the Luiseño People (La Jolla Reservation 1990) it is to mark history as a problem—not only as the lingering trauma of settler colonialism but, more significantly (for Luna’s practice), as the question of how one engages that past, how one narrates it, how one knows it, and how one feels it.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=125&annotation=KSFNKZCB))

“Luna, an artist who once sedated himself so that he might be exhibited as an artifact under museum glass (The Artifact Piece, 1987–1990), is all too aware of the ways in which his forms of expression are always already enlisted in a romantic fantasy of a traumatic past.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=126&annotation=QG89SUG7)) ~~作为一个印第安艺术家，自己的身体永远代表着是一个凄美的过去，就像亚裔的艺术家在美国的语境里永远是一种特定的符号。~~

“Luna pushes back against the pressure of making art as an Indian in part by making art with trash stewed in resentment. This opens up a world of ambivalence. If you couldn’t get that, if you took it literally, looking for a real expression of anger and some sort of spiritual relief, or if you were looking for knowing irony and cool affect, the performance was impossible to sit through.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 102](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=127&annotation=3CJ59N6Q))

“Trusting that there was something interesting waiting for us on the other side of that was hard for those unfamiliar with Luna’s work, because it really did seem like it was all just falling apart.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 103](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=128&annotation=7ILL4XQJ)) Luna的作品让人难以sit through，但是这让我想起tony的小径分叉的花园，也是等到最后的人才会收获奇迹。

“Luna does not aim hold the audience’s attention for the duration of the performance. He does not explain or show us how he feels. The performance instead recasts our relationship to him; we move from being members of an audience to something more challenging, in which we find ourselves keeping company with a difficult (and drunk) man.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 103](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=128&annotation=4C8XL54W)) 有点难想象她会不会对一个初出茅庐的人这么说。

“How can one be present to a depressive who experiences that presence as an act of aggression, as the living embodiment of his failure to connect?” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 103](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=128&annotation=3UNNMCNS)) 是不是可以对所有作品都这么说？？

“That depressive performance is set against the nostalgia that saturates mainstream, popular romance with Native American history, in which Native identity appears as always already “historical.” Renato Rosaldo’s term imperialist nostalgia names the sentimental economy that allows the imperial subject to weep over the bodies it has buried, to mourn the cultural practices it has annihilated.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 103](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=128&annotation=YZVTRREW)) The romantic native american history becomes a guilt porn for white people

“Viejo warns that the desire for this kind of transparency, for this sense of an alignment between who and what one is, lies at the heart of racist (and sexist) paradigms.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=146&annotation=7QFI7C2E)) 种族主义寻求的就是一种标签和人的一一对应。

“Racism depends on a reading of ethnic-racialized subjects that insists on their transparency; racism also banks on the faith and conceit that these subjects can be exhaustively and fully elucidated through a certain masterful operation of language.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=146&annotation=VG5ULCL2))

“Depression, as a practice of maintaining an awareness of this, can have a deeply social, deeply political dimension. The depressive appears to be stuck not by virtue of a lack of understanding but rather by virtue of his or her inability to forget.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=146&annotation=VAVZFJ9Y)) 无法忘记过去，就像漫长的季节中无法走出创伤的人们。  
  
如果是阿德勒，面对那样的创伤和不公，他会选择笑脸相迎吗？

“those histories are not there to resolve the difficulty of their work—they are not there as causal elements. They are not there to fill in the gaps of what we don’t or can’t know. Furthermore neither installation could be called tragic in a classical sense, or even sad. As much as the artists appear to perform sad, that sadness is laced with and framed by a black humor.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=146&annotation=F2W646QL)) 这些处理种族话题的艺术家并没有滥用历史的记忆——相反，这些历史是缺席的，因为作为殖民者是永远无法知晓和理解过去发生的事情的。

“Luna’s presentation of the History of the Luiseño People as a performance of depression, ambivalence, and alienation intervenes against the rendition of History as a story of evolution and progress, and also against the construction of History as a knowable past.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 121](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=146&annotation=27BURCRD)) Luna的表演不想把历史变成某种既定的事实，而是表现它的某种不可知性。他也拒绝让历史变成某种进步和进化的代表，而是a big pile of messy telephone porriage

“almost no level of irony, self-reflexivity, ambivalence, or complexity seems to ward off the urge to read the artist’s work as naïve, earnest forms of self-expression with no awareness of the complexity of representation, art history, or political institutions.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 122](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=147&annotation=BKWSSSID)) no matter how self aware artists are, art critic can sill simply label them as simple and naive.

“the difficulty of the artist’s work is actively disavowed by the literalminded critic, who projects that literalism onto the artist and her work, as is also sometimes the case with the reception of the most challenging feminist and queer work.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 122](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=147&annotation=SWLZU7LF)) It's not the artists who is being literal, it's the critics who are literal.  
  
  
But when to draw that line? what if the artist indeed didn't think through, and only the critics are imagining and fabricating the language for the artist?

“it recasts racist logics in terms of art critical judgment, negates the complexity of racial discourse itself,” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 122](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=147&annotation=QE8G8GVY)) 评论家用art critical judgement去否定种族叙事，并且认为种族叙事本身就简单无用。

“There is a false assumption in much art writing that we can be smart about emotions only if we are being cynical about them. ( Jaded is the default attitude one strikes in the social space of the art gallery about nearly everything.)” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 123](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=148&annotation=5K44P463)) ironic = smart 是一个假命题

“This “ideology of emotion,” she writes, “diagrams emotion as something lifted from a depth to a surface.” It leads us to measure representations of emotion according to how well we are convinced that those feelings represent the subject’s interior life, and according to how those feelings correspond to the interior lives of the audience. (Thus an audience member might experience Luna’s performance as a failure if she didn’t find his performance of anger convincing or if she thought it was misdirected or inappropriate.)” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 123](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=148&annotation=K49EEFYB))

“a novel could be moving exactly because the ownership of emotion is troubled and displaced from the reader onto someone else.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=150&annotation=J7V3YJC5)) 小说之所以动人，是因为读者的感情不再是自己的感情，而变成了角色的感情。

“we feel not to the extent that experience seems immediate, but to the extent that it doesn’t; not to the extent that other people’s experiences remind us of our own, but to the extent that our own seem like someone else’s.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=150&annotation=C7F5PW2K)) 我们并不是感同身受，而是因为不同所以能感受。并不是他人的感情与我们共情，而是我们的感情变得像角色的。

“An expression does not represent an already existing feeling; it is the very thing that makes emotion happen, or, more nearly, it is the thing that sets emotion into motion. Tears migrate” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=150&annotation=LIYGXQTA)) 表达并不是在模仿感情，表达本身就是情感。

“Emotions are profoundly intersubjective. They do not happen inside the individual but in relation to others.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=150&annotation=2KIUPIGL)) 情感绝非孤立的，他只能是interpersonal的。所有的情感都是人际关系。这符合阿德勒的心理学。

““Emotion,” she argues, however, “is not simply something ‘I’ or ‘we’ have. Rather it is through emotions, or how we respond to objects and others, that surfaces and boundaries are made.”” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 125](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=150&annotation=VAWCUVMX)) 我们本身没有情感。情感是皮肤，是我们和外界的边界和关系。  
  
从这个意义上来说，皮肤，触摸，本身就是情感？？（醍醐灌顶！

“Instead of being moved to tears, I felt myself shut down. A cold curiosity took over; he was making himself cry, for me, and I didn’t care.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 126](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=151&annotation=ZDK35GN8))

“The evolution of our dynamic reproduced the story of seduction, love, betrayal, and hostility that he had been recounting. It mirrored one of the stories Howells recounts, in which he handled the end of a relationship badly, hurting a man who had loved and been loyal to him. If he had just told the story, the performance would have been confessional. But the structure and poetics of Howells’s performance implicates the spectator in the artist’s injury. The participant’s detachment makes her into the artist’s tool. Guilt and anxiety circulate through this performance much the same way that tears migrate around the artist in the artworks described earlier.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 126](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=151&annotation=FVRIAFQP)) 这个表演对于《奶奶的饺子》这个作品很有借鉴意义。应该是这种故事里的后悔要体现在行动里。

“Contemporary artists have long demonstrated a critical interest in emotion as a “product” they are expected to produce. Bas Jan Ader’s I’m Too Sad to Tell You, for example, withholds the story behind his tears, and in so doing he isolates his affect as art object. His sadness appears as the work itself, and this may have been his point” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=152&annotation=88HPR54T))

“Not all emotionally intense work is difficult, but some is difficult exactly insofar as it questions what emotion is, where it comes from, to whom and to what it belongs, and even whether it can be thought of as “belonging” at all.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=152&annotation=T6K5NWFT)) 情感的作品的困难之处，在于质疑这种情感，甚至是这种情感属于谁。  
但是这是不是和前面作者说的critical distance自相矛盾了？这里怎么又开始鼓吹critical distance一样了？

“Artists take this on not only by making emotion itself their subject but by bringing the context for those feelings into the field of representation, as a means to resist exactly the kind of fetishization of emotion Ahmed describes.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 127](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=152&annotation=Z84KN3E2)) 玩弄感情的艺术家不仅在作品中使用感情，也拒绝让感情变成滥情，变成某种fetish。这可能就和表演里的撕心裂肺vs默默哭泣一样吧。

“Hidden Witness excavates an altogether different view of the relationship between African Americans and the camera, absorbing photography into African American history as a process in which black men and women are not only subjects of the camera but agents in creating and consuming the picture.” ([Doyle, 2013, p. 130](zotero://select/library/items/5VI3AXAU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMDHDB3Q?page=155&annotation=2DAZZRBQ))
