Spacers in this setting is **genderless**, they have to be castrated in order to carry out missions in the space, and other people remaining on the planets are called frelks. Frelks have a werid fascination to spacers, while also kind of excluding them. Spacers go to frelks for money, not sure in exchange for what, maybe sexual interaction, because Spacers are the ultimate safe entity for sex intercourse?

为什么会有这种fettish？可能因为社会觉得spacer不谙世事

虽然总给我一种僧侣的感觉。
