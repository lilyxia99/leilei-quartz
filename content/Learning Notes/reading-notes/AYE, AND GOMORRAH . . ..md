Spacers in this setting is **genderless**, they have to be castrated in order to carry out missions in the space, and other people remaining on the planets are called frelks. Frelks have a werid fascination to spacers, while also kind of excluding them. Spacers go to frelks for money, not sure in exchange for what, maybe sexual interaction, because Spacers are the ultimate safe entity for sex intercourse?
