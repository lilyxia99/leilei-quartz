Henry relate to the fact people don’t like to be confronted. 

All the minorities are kind of representation of minority, they are abnormal, and abnormal are treated in ways like people are:

1. Feared
2. Intrigued
3. Discriminated
4. Objectified, fetishized, domesticated, regulated
5. Trusted, which leads hero status

The reason why there is a lack of actual people of minority, is because of a lack of research. But it’s not just a lack of research, it’s because essentially a procrastination, and the actual driving force is just they don’t want to know, they discriminate. 

Writers need to care more about their characters, so are readers and scholars. Reading with this lens. It helps us:

1. Paying attention to what is there, the cultural code
2. Identify stereotypes
3. Identify a “actual” full, complex, character or story: is it a stereotype, or is it just a check boxing, or in between. 
4. Pay attention, or more aware of details

回家之后和Chrystine 聊了一下，感觉很重要的一点也是——如果人员diverse了，但是叙事还是一个colonial的叙事，角色还是在去政府其他的地方，这也不行。

# reading summary
## why not write minority characters 

“Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Amerindians, minority characters in general have been noticeably absent from most science fiction. Why”

Race is used in a very functional way, as disability, in science fiction. The author mentions that their teacher once explicitly said that brining in a black character shift the focus of the story and makes it a racial issue. 

>The presence of blacks, my teacher felt, changed the focus of the story—drew attention from the intended subject.

> the implication that a sprinkling of blacks, Asians, or others could turn the story into some sort of racial statement. 

It's not that the presence of Black people or Asian people make the topic a racial topic. It's because there wasn't enough discussion about the elephant in the room, and then when people show up we have to face the fact that we are so unfamiliar with each other despite we are living under the same roof.  

This is obvious question because it’s a question in an American context. If it's in Chinese context, I guess the conflict between man and woman would be greater than racial attention. But it's the same reason. Although China also have racial problems. 

>It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.

Nowadays we wouldn’t write a female character and thinks of it as related to feminism. It’s only because we are so unfamiliar with the presence and imagination of black character that we fail to normalize their presence in the stories. If black people is just a normal presence in your daily life, it wouldn't be weird to write and create a character like that. Just like if people with disability shows up not longer to take on any big task, then it would be really seeing them as the same.  
  
But also, I guess this is kind of in context. We also can't disregard the fact that people are in minority, and addressing that is also a kind of context making. If only to pursue a anonymous presence, could also becomes 粉饰太平 or checking box for diversity. This is also such an American thing.

Is bringing a black character, the other in a white-centered narrative, a disruptive force? It wouldn't if it is within a black fiction. This feels very similar to how disability is played out in SF, yet disability is almost always a disruptive force, and it almost becomes a narrative tools.  

>[!notes]
>It's of course a result of stereotype. But if it goes further, maybe black presence can always bring its own traits into the story.

## why does it matter!

why does it matter? it's fantasy. people will imagine their own version. Why 现实种族matters？  感觉这是一种对于种族叙事反对者会常用的话语。但是这其实是一种避重就轻吧。

> Back when Star Wars was new, a familiar excuse for ignoring minorities went something like this: “SF is escapist literature. Its readers/viewers don’t want to be weighted down with real problems.” War, okay. Planet-wide destruction, okay. Kidnapping, okay. But the sight of a minority person? Too heavy. Too real. A” (Butler, 2016, p. 2) 

People are more comfortable with obviously violent stuff than violence that is within the culture. Maybe because that's something that could have been solved, and people are trying to procrastinate on that by thinking of something seemingly impossible to solve.

没有人会公开表示自己有歧视倾向，所以他们会找一百个借口，但是歧视才是他们的主要目的。

## How to do it then?

minority people can show up in works without representing the heavy topic. It's definitely a progress.  

One step further: it also doesn't mean every such presence can't be about racial discussion. female writers feel like they have to write about feminism, but in fact they would just write as being a anyone. that could include feminism, or not.

SF writers have that problem. they are too caught up in intricate stories and plot, while forgetting that characters are the most important things. It’s probably difficult to first write about a group of people that you’re not familiar with, then it will push writers to do what they should do—research.

~~“ter, this same writer suggested that in stories that seem to require black characters to make some racial point, it might be possible to substitute extraterrestrials—so as not to dwell on matters of race” (Butler, 2016, p. 1) Race is used in a very functional way, as disability, in science fiction.

~~“Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Amerindians, minority characters in general have been noticeably absent from most science fiction. Why” (Butler, 2016, p. 1)

~~“Let’s examine my teacher’s reason. Are minority characters—black characters in this case —so disruptive a force that the mere presence of one alters a story, focuses it on race rather than whatever the author had in mind? Yes, in fact, black characters can do exactly that if the creators of those characters are too restricted in their thinking to visualize blacks in any other context” (Butler, 2016, p. 1) is bringing a black character, the other in a white-centered narrative, a disruptive force? It wouldn't if it is within a black fiction. This feels very similar to how disability is played out in SF, yet disability is almost always a disruptive force, and it almost becomes a narrative tools.  
  
  
~~It's of course a result of stereotype. But if it goes further, maybe black presence can always bring its own traits into the story.

~~“No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with the usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would have trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black characters. No writer who regards blacks as people would get sidetracked into justifying their blackness or their presence unless such justification honestly played a part in the story. It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.” (Butler, 2016, p. 2) If black people is just a normal presence in your daily life, it wouldn't be weird to write and create a character like that.

“e possibility of substituting extraterrestrials for blacks—in order to make some race-related point without making anyone ... uncomfortable? In fact, why can’t blacks be represented by whites who are not too thoroughly described, thus leaving readers free to use their imaginations and visualize whichever color they like” (Butler, 2016, p. 2)

“~~And as for whites representing all of humanity—on the theory that people will imagine other races; or better yet, on the theory that all people are alike anyway, so what does it matter? Well, remember when men represented all of humanity? Women didn’t care much for it. Still don’t. No great mental leap is required to understand why blacks, why any minority, might not care much for it either. And apart from all that, of course, it doesn’t work. Whites represent themselves, and that’s plenty. Spread the burden” (Butler, 2016, p. 2) 感觉这是一种对于种族叙事反对者会常用的话语。why does it matter? it's fantasy. people will imagine their own version.

“ere again is ~~the implication that a sprinkling of blacks, Asians, or others could turn the story into some sort of racial statement.~~ The only statement I could imagine being made by such a sprinkling would be that among the white, human people; the tall, furry people; the lumpy, scaly people; the tentacled people, etc., were also brown, human people; black, human people, etc. This isn’t such a heavy statementunless it’s missing.” (Butler, 2016, p. 2) ~~It's not that the presence of Black people or Asian people make the topic a racial topic.

~~One step further: it also doesn't mean every such presence can't be about racial discussion.~~

“Why are there so few black SF writers?” I suspect for the same reason there were once so few women SF writers. Women found a certain lack of authenticity in a genre that postulated a universe largely populated by men, in which all the power was in male hands, and women stayed in their maledefined places.” (Butler, 2016, p. 3) ~~female writers feel like they have to write about feminism, but in fact they would just write as being a anyone. that could include feminism, or not~~.

“acism is unfashionable now, and thus is unlikely to be brought into the open. Instead, it can be concealed behind any of the questions and arguments I’ve already discussed.” (Butler, 2016, p. 3) 没有人会公开表示自己有歧视倾向，所以他们会找一百个借口，但是歧视才是他们的主要目的。

“—if the speaker thinks he has a sympathetic audience. People resent being told their established way of doing things is wrong, resent being told they should change, and strongly resent being told they won’t be alone any longer in the vast territory—the universe—they’ve staked out for themselves.” (Butler, 2016, p. 3)

“Men who feel defensive about sexist behavior may make sexist bigots of themselves. W” (Butler, 2016, p. 3)

“what do authors ordinarily do when they decide to write about an unfamiliar subject? They research. They read—in this case recent biographies and autobiographies of people in the group they want to write about are good. They talk to members of that group—friends, acquaintances, coworkers, fellow students, even strangers on buses or waiting in lines. I’ve done these things myself in my reverse research, and they help. Also, I people-watch a lot without talking. Any public situation offers opportunities” (Butler, 2016, p. 4)

“More important than technique, however, is for authors to remember that they are writing about people. Authors who forget this, who do not relax and get comfortable with their racially different characters, can wind up creating unbelievable, self-consciously manipulated puppets; pieces of furniture who exist within a story but contribute nothing to it; or stereotypes guaranteed to be offensive.” (Butler, 2016, p. 4) ~~SF writers have that problem. they are too caught up in intricate stories and plot, while forgetting that characters are the most important things.~~
