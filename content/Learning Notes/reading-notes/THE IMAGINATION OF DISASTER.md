## Tropes in Sci-fi

科幻一方面让我们从平庸中脱离，一方面让更无法忍受之物变得习惯。Being entertained makes the situation looks bearable. Humor becomes a coping mechanism. Also the tropes help with that anticipation cushion. 之所以科幻灾难片里有这么多搞笑有趣的台词，或许是因为实际上人们没有经历过这些事情。

这篇文章写在60年代，30年代sci-fi 开始，

WW1—1930–1945（WW2）–1948（UN成立）—太空冒险出现–1965（这篇文章写作的时间）—种族隔离结束—Vietnam—尼克森总统—2001/9/11–2024–Palestinian genocide(started in 1948)

科幻片里也有很多套路：孤胆英雄发现危险，但是警告无人响应。感觉完全是李文亮的剧本啊……虽然他没有活下来


## dehumanization

怪物是不需要被共情的。怪物比人类低贱，可以被毁灭。非人之物的革命可以是玩笑。长得不像人是primitive的，是没有主体性的，是像动物一样的。当然，这有时候甚至和眼睛的设计有关——有眼睛的角色总是让人觉得更像人。可以被拟人化的东西让我们觉得更亲近。

这可能也和少数群体不被写作有关系？

这些事物是可以被抹杀的，就像哥斯拉一样。只要哥斯拉被消灭了，这个电影就让人满足了。如果电影最后没有happy ending，这个电影=not worth it. 

对于丧尸、杀人机器的恐惧，也是对于一种去人化的恐惧。 这是科幻恐怖片里的stake——你有可能会被抹杀。



## Why do we have those tropes

“(1) The arrival of the thing. (Emergence of the monsters, landing of the alien space-ship, etc.) This is usually witnessed, or suspected, by just one person, .who is a young scientist on a field trip. Nobody, neither his neighbors nor his colleagues, will believe him for some time. The hero is not married, but has a sympathetic though also incredulous girlfriend.” (Sontag, p. 42) 这感觉完全是李文亮的剧本啊……虽然他没有活下来

“with radiation, or has built a machine to communicate with beings from other planets or to transport him to other places or times.” (Sontag, p. 43) 时间穿越剧本

“For example: the temperature of the earth is becoming too high or too low to support life, or the earth is cracking in two, or it is gradually being blanketed by lethal fallout.” (Sontag, p. 43) 这不是流浪地球吗

“I propose to discuss science fiction films (the present period began in 1950 and continues, considerably abated, to this day) as an independent sub-genre, without reference to the novels from which, in many cases, they were adapted. For while novel and film may share the same plot, the fundamental difference between the resources of the novel and the film makes them quite dissimilar.” (Sontag, p. 43) 科幻电影和小说还不太一样，因为电影，特别是院线电影，要求它必须要拥有一定的戏剧张力。

“Good novels rarely make good films, but excellent films are often made from poor or trivial novels.” (Sontag, p. 43) 笑死，桑塔格好真实，好小说很少做成好电影，但是好电影往往来自烂小说。

“Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art. In science fiction films, disaster is rarely viewed intensively; it is always extensive.” (Sontag, p. 44) 科幻电影不是关于科学，而是关于灾难的。不过这么一想感觉儒尔凡尔纳的小说是少有的真的就是纯纯关于探险的。

“the science fiction film (like a very different contemporary genre, the Happening) is concerned with the aesthetics of destruction, with the peculiar beauties to be found in wreaking havoc, making a mess.” (Sontag, p. 44) 科幻的美学是关于摧毁的美学

“(Hollywood budget needs usually dictate that the town be in the Arizona or California desert.” (Sontag, p. 44)

“Technicolor, allows a much greater play back and forth among several model environments. There is the populous city. There is the lavish but ascetic interior of the space ship-either the invaders' or ours-replete with streamlined chromium fixtures and dials, and machines whose complexity is indicated by the number of colored lights they flash and strange noises they emit.” (Sontag, p. 44)

“Visually there is little difference between mass havoc as represented in the old horror and monster films and what we find in science fiction films, except (again) scale.” (Sontag, p. 44) 哥斯拉为什么讨论和科幻电影这么像，因为本质上是一家的。

“The old science fiction films, and most of the comics, still have an essentially innocent relation to disaster. Mainly they offer new versions of the oldest romance of all-of the strong invulnerable hero with the mysterious lineage come to do battle on behalf of good and against evil.” (Sontag, p. 44) 过去的科幻电影，主角和灾难之间还是更多是一种无瓜的关系，在灾难面前主角是纯洁的。

“Recent science fiction films have a decided grimness, bolstered by their much greater degree of visual credibility, which contrasts strongly with the older films.” (Sontag, p. 44) 近来的科幻电影，在视觉风格的变化下，变得更加黑暗

“Fantasy is that it releases one from normal obligations.” (Sontag, p. 45) 在灾难面前，生活中鸡毛蒜皮的琐事和责任都变得无足轻重。

“Another kind of satisfaction these films supply is extreme moral simplification-that is to say, a morally acceptable fantasy where one can give outlet to cruel or at least amoral feelings.” (Sontag, p. 45) 在科幻电影中，道德是简单的。同时灾难化的背景提供了给“不道德”出现的机会。

“Science fiction films are one of the purest forms of spectacle; that is, we are rarely inside anyone's feelings.” (Sontag, p. 45) 科幻电影是纯粹的景观，我们甚至不会有机会关心角色是怎样的

“Things, rather than the helpless humans, are the locus of values because we experience them, rather than people, as the sources of power. According to science fiction films, man is naked without his artifacts.” (Sontag, p. 45) 物，也就是科技产物，才是科幻中力量的中心。就像流浪地球里的行星发动机，空间站，或者是万神殿里的上载和算法。这是科幻电影和恐怖电影不同的一点——科幻电影讲述的是物品如何击溃敌人，而人，看似是共情的中心，实则是这其中的媒介。

“The science fiction films are strongly moralistic. The standard message is the one about the proper, or humane, uses of science, versus the mad, obsessional use of science.” (Sontag, p. 45) The message of sci-fi film is always to show the two bladed nature of science, and tell you to choose the "good" one instead of the "bad" one.

“In the horror films, we have the mad or obsessed or misguided scientist who pursues his experiments against good advice to the contrary, creates a monster or monsters, and is himself destroyed” (Sontag, p. 45) 恐怖电影中的科学怪人往往不停人劝，使用科技制造出怪物，或者是把自己变成怪物进而带来毁灭。

“One science fiction equivalent of this is the scientist, usually a member of a team, who defects to the planetary invaders because "their" science is more advanced than "ours."” (Sontag, p. 45) 三体中的叶文洁某种意义上是这种投靠人物的代表。

“In this film, both sides of the ambivalence toward scientists are given voice. Generally, for a scientific enterprise to be treated entirely sympathetically in these films, it needs the certificate of utility. Science, viewed without ambivalence, means an efficacious response to danger.” (Sontag, p. 45) 科学在电影中往往要表现出这种矛盾的状态。科学必须要有用才能让人同情。科学是一种对危机最有效的应对措施。

“this suspicion is usually directed at the scientist rather than his work. The creative scientist may become a martyr to his own discovery, through an accident or by pushing things too far.” (Sontag, p. 45) 有创意的科学家往往会被自己的发明所害，而保守的技师通常能把事情做稳妥。

“it is not enough to remark that contemporary attitudes-as reflected in science fiction films-remain ambivalent, that the scientist is treated both as satanist and savior. The proportions have changed, because of the new context in which the old admiration and fear of the scientist is located. For his sphere of influence is no longer local, himself or his immediate community. It is planetary, cosmic.” (Sontag, p. 46) 科学家是撒旦也是救世主，而ta影响的反而也不再只是一个小镇，而是整个星球。

“particularly in the Japanese films, but not only there, that mass trauma exists over the use of nuclear weapons and the possibility of future nuclear wars.” (Sontag, p. 46) 很多科幻电影里都有核战争的影子，或者代表核创伤的隐喻。

“one detects the hunger for a "good war," which poses no moral problems, admits of no moral qualifications. The imagery of science fiction films will satisfy the most bellicose addict of war films, for a lot of the satisfactions of war films pass, untransformed, into science fiction films.” (Sontag, p. 46) 科幻片不仅满足了恐怖片的欲望，也满足了战争片的需要。

“the bellicosity of science fiction films is neatly channeled into the yearning for peace, or for at least peaceful coexistence.” (Sontag, p. 46) 然而好战的同时，科幻片也往往在呼唤和平，或者至少一种和平的共存，就像三体里面和三体人一样。

“Science-technology-is conceived of as the great unifier. Thus the science fiction films also project a utopian fantasy. In the classic models of utopian thinking-Plato's Republic, Campanella's City of the Sun, More's Utopia, Swift's land of the Houyhnhnms, Voltaire's Eldorado-society had worked out a perfect consensus.” (Sontag, p. 47) 科幻世界里总是有一个联合政府，就像流浪地球里那样，认为未来人们会在灾难面前联合起来，会联手发展科技并用科技保卫自己。

“It is interesting, too, that societies in which reason was pictured as totally ascendant were also traditionally pictured as having an ascetic and/or materially frugal and economically simple mode of life. But in the utopian world community projected by science fiction films, totally pacified and ruled by scientific concensus, the demand for simplicity of material existence would be absurd.” (Sontag, p. 47) 一般的故事里，人类哲学和理性越占主导，社会的物质生活越保守。相反，在科幻故事中，如果存在这种被通过科学达成的大统一，如果整个世界都被一种科学逻辑所统治，里面的物质生活往往也是极大丰富的。

“Besides these new anxieties about physical disaster, the prospect of universal mutilation and even annihilation, the science fiction films reflect powerful anxieties about the condition of the individual psyche.” (Sontag, p. 47)

“The other-world creatures which seek to take "us" over, are an "it," not a "they." The planetary invaders are usually zombie-like. Their movements are either cool, mechanical, or lumbering, blobby. But it amounts to the same thing.” (Sontag, p. 47)

“They are the wave of the future, man in his next stage of development.” (Sontag, p. 47) ~~对于丧尸、杀人机器的恐惧，也是对于一种去人化的恐惧。~~

“They do not simply kill the person. They obliterate him.” (Sontag, p. 47)

“In another version of this fantasy, the body is preserved but the person is entirely reconstituted as the automatized servant or agent of the alien powers.” (Sontag, p. 47) 这就像hive mind里人的主体性被抹杀了。这比杀死人更让人恐惧。

“The person is really dead, but he doesn't know it. He's "undead," he has become an "unperson."” (Sontag, p. 47) 比死去更恐怖的是变成丧尸，是死了但是又没死，是变成工具的一部分。

“he wants to retain his humanity. But once the deed has been done, the victim is eminently satisfied with his condition. He has not been converted from human amiability to monstrous "animal" bloodlust (a metaphoric exaggeration of sexual desire), as in the old vampire fantasy. No, he has simply become far more efficient-the very model of technocratic man, purged of emotions, volitionless, tranquil, obedient to all orders.” (Sontag, p. 47) 吸血鬼电影中变成吸血鬼的人变得残暴嗜血，而科幻中被夺舍的人，仅仅是变得更有效率了，就像Ulati一样。

“Now the danger is understood as residing in man's ability to be turned into a machine.” (Sontag, p. 47)

“xHE RULE, of course, is that this horrible and T irremediable form of murder can strike anyone in the film except the hero.” (Sontag, p. 47) 笑死，太真实了。不管这种冲击会波及多少人，总之主角是不会死的。

“He learns, however, that he will shortly be upgraded into a "humanoid" having all the properties of a real man.” (Sontag, p. 48)

“this theme of dehumanization is perhaps the most fascinating.” (Sontag, p. 48)

“The attitude of the science fiction films toward depersonalization is mixed. On the one hand, they deplore it as the ultimate horror. On the other hand, certain characteristics of the dehumanized invaders, modulated and disguised -such as the ascendancy of reason over feelings, the idealization of teamwork and the consensuscreating activities of science, a marked degree of moral simplification-are precisely traits of the savior-scientists.” (Sontag, p. 48) 科幻电影中的去人化是中性的。一方面它会带来危机，但另一方面解铃还需系铃人，这种理性凌驾于感情之上的特质，这种理想主义的合作和简单直接（甚至热血）的道德标准，正是救世主也所仰仗的。

“when the scientist in these films is treated negatively, it is usually done through the portrayal of an individual scientist who holes up in his laboratory and neglects his fiancee or his loving wife and children, obsessed by his daring and dangerous experiments. The scientist as a loyal member of a team, and therefore considerably less individualized, is treated quite respectfully.” (Sontag, p. 48) 一个solo的科学家，不顾家的科学家，往往也是科学怪人的种子。一个更有集体意识的科学家才是更被尊重的。  
  
事实上这在现实中也是这样的。或者可以说，科幻里的这种表现，是我们对于不顾家者的一种谴责，通过把他们变成怪物来表达这种不屑。并不是因为不顾家就会变成怪物，这种变化代表的知识社会的总体意识。

“There is absolutely no social criticism, of even the most implicit kind, in science fiction films. No criticism, for example, of the conditions of our society which create the impersonality and dehumanization which science fiction fantasies displace onto the influence of an alien It.” (Sontag, p. 48)

“In science fiction films the antithesis of black magic and white is drawn as a split between technology, which is beneficent, and the errant individual will of a lone intellectual.” (Sontag, p. 48) 科幻电影中，技术是中立的，是不被批判的。个人意志是最危险的东西，而在壳子里的鬼魂——那科技，只是科技罢了。

“The theme of depersonalization (being "taken over") which I have been talking about is a new allegory reflecting the ageold awareness of man that, sane, he is always perilously close to insanity and unreason.” (Sontag, p. 48) 不管是科幻电影还是恐怖电影，核心的危机往往都是人的去人化和非理性。  
  
某种意义上这是不是也对应了某种对intellectual disability的恐惧？

“Similarly, it is not enough to note that science fiction allegories are one of the new myths about -that is, ways of accommodating to and negating -the perennial human anxiety about death.” (Sontag, p. 48) 科幻故事只是人们长久以来对于死亡的一种恐惧的眼神。

“in the middle of the 20th century when it became clear that from now on to the end of human history, every person would spend his individual life not only under the threat of individual death, which is certain, but of something almost unsupportable psychologically-collective incineration and extinction which could come any time, virtually without warning.” (Sontag, p. 48) 人们对于死亡的恐惧已经不仅仅是个人的死亡了，更多是一个种族的灭绝——因为天灾人祸。即便是上载，也是关于一整个星球的政治博弈。

“The expectation of the apocalypse may be the occasion for a radical disaffiliation from society” (Sontag, p. 48)

“peoples learn the news of their own end in diverse ways. It is reported that in 1945 the populace of Berlin received without great agitation the news that Hitler had decided to kill them all, before the Allies arrived, because they had not been worthy enough to win the war.” (Sontag, p. 48) 我们就像无动于衷的柏林人，知道大难临头，但是只是因为大势已去便放弃。科幻电影的出现，或许就是因为这种无动于衷——它希望人们紧张起来，意识到自己的反应不足和麻木顺从。然而矛盾的是，这种刺激，就像桑塔格在最开始说的那样，逐渐变成了某种合理化和常态化，似乎反而让灾难变成了某种舒适区和意料之内的未来。
