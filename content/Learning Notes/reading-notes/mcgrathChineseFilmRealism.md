> From the time that Jurassic Park (Steven Spielberg, 1993) revolutionized the integration of CGI with live- action photography and Toy Story ( John Lasseter, 1995) became the first fully computer- animated feature movie, it seemed that it was just a matter of time before celluloid- based photographic film became as ir- relevant as vinyl records— remaining only as a niche market for nostalgic buffs

> once live- action footage is digitized (or directly recorded in a digital format), it loses its privileged indexical relationship to prefilmic reality.  The computer does not distinguish between an image obtained through a photographic lens, an image created in a paint program, or an image synthesized in a 3- D graphics package, since they are all made from the same material— pixels. And pixels, regardless of their origin, can be eas- ily altered, substituted for one another, and so on. Live- action footage is thus reduced to just another graphic, no different than images created manually.9

> What Manovich is arguing, then, is that with digital photography, the indexical nature of cinema is lost, and it becomes principally an iconic art again, like painting. The reduction of the image to digital code subject to infinite possibilities of manipulation by a computer compromises its cause– effect relationship with the external world and therefore makes even live- action photography potentially a mere tool of animation

> Ethan Coen has said that whereas shooting on traditional film forces the filmmaker to more or less commit to how a shot is going to look at the moment of shooting, shooting digitally is less like taking a picture than cap- turing information that subsequently will be turned into a picture: “when you’re capturing it on film, it’s actually in the grain of the negative, . . .  and when you’re capturing it digitally, you’re just sort of recording pixels, all of which are negotiable later.”17

Obviously, a shift to the virtual realism of the new CGI- enhanced story world means that actors do not need to ride, say, a Pandoran banshee in Avatar, since that action will be constructed by digital graphics animators after filming.18

Like Rambo, he is portrayed “as a virtuous victim whose only motive is a melodramatic desire to return to the innocence of an unproblematic love of country and the simple demand for that love’s return.”29 The pathos of Leng Feng’s situation increases the audience’s strong identification with him when the film’s spectacular action sequences play out, particularly when he faces off directly with the film’s chief vil- lain, an American mercenary leader called Big Daddy, an embodiment of evil and greed who kills indiscriminately

In fact, this example resonates not only with Mao- era military films but also with the contemporary versions: the character who thus sacrifices himself is played by none other than Wu Jing, the director and star of Wolf Warrior 2 from two years earlier.

Both are built on the premise of a dying planet Earth neces- sitating humanity’s relocation to another solar system; both share an obsession with fatherhood and with repairing an estrangement between father and child; both feature a spaceship with circular rotating parts; and both climax with breathtaking acts of self- sacrifice in which the main hero intentionally plummets to his apparent death— being sucked into a black hole in Interstellar and being consumed in a fiery crash into Jupiter

Whereas his early films seemed suffused with the confidence that a filmmaker with sufficient courage and vision could go out in the streets of China and document in fiction films those realities that seemed to be omitted from mass media representations in general, with these films, Jia seems to interrogate his own subject position as a relayer of such images.
