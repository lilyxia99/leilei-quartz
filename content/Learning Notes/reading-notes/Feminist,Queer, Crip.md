> Her cyborg was a radical border-crosser, blurring the boundaries between human and animal, machine and organism, physical and non-physical.3 such a cyborg, she argued, could “guide us to a more livable place,” an “elsewhere,” in which “people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints.”4 This potential arose from the cyborg’s hybridity, its transgression of boundaries and categories; because it does not, or cannot, privilege unity or sameness, it offers “a way out of the maze of dualisms” that characterize Western thought.5

> Thus, she warns against feminist approaches that serve only to heighten the dualism between science and nature by rejecting technology outright. Her manifesto is an alternative to those feminisms that “have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body.”11 The feminist task, then, is not to plot some escape from technology, or to map our return to a preindustrial eden, but rather to contest for other meanings of, or other relations with, technoscience. The cyborg serves as a theoretical framework for such contestation

> Haraway’s second intervention, then, was in “some streams of the white women’s movement in the united states” that naturalize “woman.”13 For Haraway, the boundary-crossing cyborg could be a productive intervention in such debates, shifting the terrain of feminist thought and practice from monolithic identities to shifting affinities. Drawing on Chela sandoval’s work on women of color and “oppositional consciousness,” Haraway pushes for a feminism not “on the basis of natural identification, but . . . on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship.”14 Through her cyborg figure, she suggests that “the future of socialist feminism” requires a politics open to the possibility that “[g]ender might not be a global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.”15

The Berkeley Collective disagreed, ushering the piece into publication.16 But the questions raged: Was the cyborg figure emancipatory or reactionary? Was the manifesto based in critique or was it an undertheorized celebration of technology? Could the cyborg figure point to a socialist feminist future? Were we all cyborgs, as Haraway claimed?

What, finally, is the relationship between disability and the cyborg?

A cyborg politics would not require an amputee, a blind person, and a psychiatric survivor to present their identities and experiences as the same, or even all amputees’ experiences as the same, but rather would encourage the formation of flexible coalitions to achieve shared goals

> The cyborgs of popular culture bear little resemblance to the cyborgs of Haraway’s manifesto. robocops and terminators, they are more likely to engage in spectacular acts of violent hypermasculinity than in feminist theory and practice; their enhanced bodies seem to reify gender differences rather than critique them. indeed, feminist critics from Anne Balsamo to Claudia springer warn that such cyborgs will do little to transform existing gender relations, and their exaggerated able-bodiedness suggests that they offer few resources to disability theory or politics.

> The term “cyborg” in these stories, associated with the forward-looking “rise,” operates as evocative shorthand for adaptive technology, associating such technology with a promising future for “the disabled.” it quickly becomes clear, even after only a cursory reading of these kinds of cyborg stories, that “cyborg” and “physically disabled person” are seen as synonymous. Or, rather, that “person with physical disabilities” is a self-evident, commonsense category of cyborgism. The reporters do not explain what they mean by “cyborg” or what leads them to describe disabled people in cyborgian terms. They assume that their readers will easily and uncritically understand disabled people as cyborgs and link their future to one of medical technology; no explanation or definition is apparently required.

> Baker predicts that, “[w]hile the immediate future is filled with hope for the disabled, cyborg technology may soon spread, giving ordinary people extraordinary skills.”36 On the one hand, Baker’s claim can be seen as erasing the disabled/nondisabled divide in assuming that everyone can benefit from these technologies. On the other hand, however, her “soon” reminds us that disabled people are the only immediate cyborgs; “ordinary” people will have to wait.37 For the time being, then, “cyborg” is linked more directly to disabled bodies than to ablebodied ones.

Anna salleh, writing for an Australian news outlet, described the pistorius case as one involving “the competing rights of cyborgs and non-cyborgs.”39 Bloggers from both sports and technology sites described the case in terms of the arrival of the “cyborg athlete,” an arrival that would change everything about how we understand athletics. not only was pistorius’s cyborgization taken for granted in these stories, but so, too—and relatedly—was his difference. As swartz and Watermeyer note, doping can also be seen as cyborg technology, but athletes accused of doping are not described in those terms; physical disability and its attendant technologies render one cyborgian in a way nothing else can

A nondisabled runner, in other words, is natural, unmixed, unadulterated; it is only the presence of the prosthetic that makes one impure, or no longer purely natural.41 The “cyborg” concept thus serves to perpetuate binaries of pure/impure, natural/unnatural, and natural/technological; rather than breaking down boundaries, it buttresses them.

> in 1995, Christopher reeve, the actor famous for portraying superman in the movies, fell from his horse Buck and became a quadriplegic. A sad story? Yes, certainly, but also a heroic cyborg tale.”44 Although i can find no instance of reeve referring to himself as a cyborg, he apparently struck Gray as the most effective way to introduce the cyborg figure to his readers. As Gray explains in an earlier article (coauthored with steven mentor), “[t]he quadriplegic patient totally dependent on a vast array of high-tech equipment” is one of the best examples of a true cyborg.4

> This kind of language is directly related to Gray’s depiction of quadriplegics as definitive cyborgs: if disability is all that is needed to render one cyborg, and disability is the sum of one’s identity, then cyborg becomes one’s identity. Quadriplegics, like reeve, simply are cyborgs

> Drawing on Haraway, Gray articulates the “cyborg citizen” as someone who recognizes the importance of crafting contingent alliances and engaging in dissent. Yet he praises reeve for mobilizing a “united front of invalid cyborgs,” describing how the late actor “catalyzed the unification” of disabled people in his quest for a cure.48 This description is troubling for many reasons, perhaps most obviously for its implication that prior to reeve’s accident, people with mobility impairments were aimless, unconnected, and politically inactive, unable to participate in society. Gray’s rhetoric suggests that not only is reeve’s quest for the cure the only appropriate response to disability

> What i want to highlight, though, is that Gray discusses politics as a process of unification and universal agreement only in terms of disability; elsewhere in his book he describes cyborg politics as contentious, diverse, and complicated, where one achieves or participates in “cyborg citizenship” through one’s political acts. He primarily describes reeve and his fellow “invalid cyborgs,” however, in terms of their bodies, not their contentious acts, and repeatedly highlights their “unification.” Thus, disability activists in general and reeve in particular disappear when Gray moves on to articulate his politics of shifting and contingent alliances. This disappearance suggests that Gray is concerned with disability only insofar as he can use the disabled body as an illustration of human-machine interactions; disability as a complicated lived experience, and disabled people as a diverse group encompassing a range of opinions, are apparently not political, not in the realm of cyborg politics

> Thus the term “cyborg,” rather than entailing a critique of existing categories and ideologies, is used to perpetuate distinctions between “normal” and “abnormal” bodies, distinctions that have material consequences involving discrimination, economic inequalities, and restricted access. if nondisabled people are persuaded by the assertion that disabled people are real-life cyborgs, then cyborg status signals a distinction between nondisabled people and disabled people. Cyborg qualities become markers of difference, suggesting an essential difference between disabled people and nondisabled people. Any potential transgressive tendencies in the term are lost when these labels become locked to certain bodies. “Cyborg” itself becomes reified, reduced to a particular kind of body.

> “perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization.”55 With that parenthetical “sometimes,” Haraway leaves open the possibility that some disabled people might not achieve cyborgian hybridization, but states that those who do reach it experience “the most intense” versions of it. in noting that intensity, Haraway positions disability as one of the best means of achieving cyborgian boundary-blurring, suggesting that people with disabilities are exemplary cyborgs. indeed, disabled people are one of the few types of “real-life cyborgs” hailed in the text.

> While Haraway celebrates the story for its challenge to assumptions about “[g]ender, sexuality, and embodiment,” it certainly echoes longstanding ableist assumptions about the uselessness of physically disabled bodies and the necessity of the technological fix, even—or especially—one that destroys the disabled body altogether. But Haraway needed just such a figure to make her argument about the cyborg; she was relying on her readers having an idea of what “severe handicap” looks like, an idea as fictional as the one in the story. in other words, she needed the stereotyped assumption that “severe handicap” means “total dependence” in order to convince her readers of the existence of bodies that don’t “end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin,” the passage that immediately follows the reference to disability.6

> The “severely handicapped” girl in mcCaffrey’s story thus serves as the segue into that reading, but structurally, she remains apart from it. it is hard, then, to read disability or disabled bodies as active participants in the cyborg politics Haraway articulates. Disabled people serve neither as the creators of cyborg writing (they are not included in “women of color” or the authors of science fiction) nor as the subjects of feminist literary criticism. nor, for that matter, as the active subjects in their own narratives: while Haraway uses the passive tense to describe the cyborg political work of The Ship Who Sang (“Gender, sexuality, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story”), she employs the active tense to describe the work of the characters in stories that do not hinge on the character’s disabilities.64 in other words, although Haraway recognizes the potential insights to be derived from the experience of living with disability technology, casting disability as a challenge to “organic holism,” she presents disability in remarkably monolithic terms, as a single, universal experience.

Their “nimble fingers,” a description indebted to colonialist and racist stereotypes, link their bodies to the machines they are building. Based on Haraway’s stated preference for affinity politics, it can be inferred that the santa rita protestors are cyborg because their antinuclear activism is based on coalition politics and affinity groups. Haraway may also position the protestors as cyborgs to stress that there is no position outside of technology; even as they protest certain manifestations of the technological age, they are simultaneously implicated in those same technologies

As Christina Crosby argues, it is “dynamic, mobile, [and] programmable, which makes the cyborg incalculably dangerous in the form of a cruise missile, but also offers opportunities that haven’t yet been calculated for forming new alliances, new affinity groups, new coalitions.”77

> “pushing” the figure from a disability perspective entails bringing a disability consciousness to the cyborg, attending to the specific benefits and dangers it harbors for disabled people. This shift requires an acknowledgment that human/machine interfaces are not always beneficial or pleasurable; an awareness that many disabled people lack access to the cybertechnologies so highly praised in cyborg writing; an accounting for the ways in which cybertechnologies rely on disabling labor practices across the globe; and a realization that not all disabled people are interested in technological cures or fixes. each of these elements takes cyborgology away from its traditional use of disability as metaphor, and toward an understanding of disability in political and social context. in so doing, they also—and ironically—bring cyborg theory closer to the promise of Haraway’s manifesto, a promise of a fully situated cyborg that refuses easy celebrations of human/technology connections.

Again, her cyborgism is not so much about the fact that she needs attendants or uses a power wheelchair but rather that she uses her experiences with both technologies to force people—disabled and nondisabled—to confront our ableist assumptions about disability and sexuality.

From a cyborgian perspective, this sign is brilliantly provocative and productive. it draws on the pervasive idea that adaptive technologies grant superior abilities, not merely replacing a lost capacity but enhancing it, yet it does so in a highly subversive way. The message here isn’t about blending in, about passing as normal or hypernormal, but about publicly announcing the viability of a queer disabled location. it’s disnormalizing, adamantly refusing compulsory heterosexuality, compulsory able-bodiedness, and homonormativity. As Corbett O’toole argues, it challenges the perceived passivity of disabled women, presenting them as actively pleasuring their partners, thereby graphically refuting stereotypes linking physical disability with nonsexuality.9

> From a cyborg perspective, i am enticed by Hershey’s provocative relationship to medical technologies. On the one hand, her very survival relies on this technology, a technology made possible by the medical industrial complex that supports and is supported by organizations like the mDA. On the other hand, she uses this technology to make her activism possible, activism that is often committed to interrogating the very system that she relies on. Hershey, in other words, is well-positioned to recognize the complexities of technology and biomedicine. As Haraway made clear in the manifesto, simple technophilia or technophobia is untenable; what we need to do is to take responsibility for the social relations of science and technology.102 By tracing the effects of cure ideologies and pity narratives, by highlighting the economic assumptions and mechanisms of the telethon, Hershey and her comrades push for exactly this kind of responsibility without naively abandoning such technology altogether. Yet if Hershey were to be described in cyborg terms, most theorists would ignore these savvy negotiations, focusing only on her position in a wheelchair. reducing Hershey to a cyborg because of her wheelchair or breathing tube ignores her cyborg political practices, thereby perpetuating the depoliticization of disability and disabled people.

A cripped cyborg politics, however, refuses to stop with this kind of recitation of diagnosis or condition. Following robert mcruer, “severe” can be read as defiance, fierceness, critique; the “severity” of these women’s impairments is due not to their perceived failures to adhere to normative expectations of movement, flexibility, or appearance, but to their public “call[ing] out [of] the inadequacies of compulsory able-bodiedness.”103

As a trans woman, she is “invisible” to her health insurance company yet dependent on her medications, and it is this contradictory stance that leads her to the cyborg.108 inspired by Haraway’s manifesto, she describes her position within biomedicine as contradictory, ironic, subversive. she may be interfacing with corporate medicine, but she does so “improperly.”109

> Dean spade recognizes that many trans people’s reliance on medical institutions necessitates a contradictory politics. He explains that some transgender advocates have turned to state disability laws as a potential site of relief from gender discrimination; filing such claims, however, requires that transgendered people be diagnosed with and identify as having gender identity disorder, or GiD.111 GiD is controversial within trans communities, with many activists wary of its identification of gender difference as pathology. As spade writes, “i do not want to make trans rights dependent upon GiD diagnoses, because such diagnoses are not accessible to many low-income people; because i believe that the diagnostic and treatment processes for GiD are regulatory and promote a regime of coercive binary gender; and because i believe that GiD is still being misused by some mental health practitioners as a basis for involuntary psychiatric treatment for gender transgressive people.”112 At the same time, because “many trans people’s lives are entangled with medical establishments,” their best hope is a medical diagnosis and the recognition and access to services it entails.113 in describing the strategic use of medical models of difference, spade carefully maps the implications of such uses, challenging ableism within trans communities while detailing the risks of disability identification. reading Lewis, O’Brien, and spade together reveals that neither medical technologies nor diagnoses can be characterized as purely oppressive or politically neutral. As Haraway’s cyborg insists, cyborg bodies are “maps of power,” requiring ironic, doubled, contradictory responses.

We can describe the fluid nature of disability or articulate a disability politics that embraces contradiction and ambiguity without referencing Haraway or deploying the figure of the cyborg. moreover, the cyborg figure may be more useful in examining some disabilities than others; it might be less effective in explorations of blindness than deafness, for example, or Down syndrome than amputation. At the risk of undercutting my argument, i want to acknowledge that cyborg theory is not necessary.

> Yet the very pervasiveness of the social model has prevented disability studies from engaging with the wider environment of wilderness, parks, and nonhuman nature because the social model seems to falter in such settings. stairs can be replaced or supplemented with ramps and elevators, but what about a steep rock face or a sandy beach? Like stairs, both pose problems for most wheelchair users, but, argues tom shakespeare, “it is hard to blame the natural environment on social arrangements.”1 He asserts that the natural environment—rock cliffs, steep mountains, and sandy beaches—offers proof that “people with impairments will always be disadvantaged by their bodies”; the social model cannot adequately address the barriers presented by those kinds of spaces.2 i, too, recognize the limitations of the social model and the need to engage with the materiality of bodies, but i am not so sure that the “natural environment” is as distinct from the “built environment” as shakespeare suggests. On the contrary, the natural environment is also “built”: literally so in the case of trails and dams, metaphorically so in the sense of cultural constructions and deployments of “nature,” “natural,” and “the environment.”
