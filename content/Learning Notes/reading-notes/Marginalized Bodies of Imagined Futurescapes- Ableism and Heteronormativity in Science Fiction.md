> In science fiction in particular many characters with disabilities have been subjected to technological alterations, effectively “curing” them. Both of these re- presentational traditions obscure the existence of these characters in science fic- tion. Consequently, there is an ambiguity of existence, as they are simultaneously there and not there.

> “[t]he medical characterization of the disabled body as re- quiring cure – in order to become ‘normal’ – has become part of our larger cultu- ral construction of disability” (Allen 2013: 9). Consequently, much science fiction has focused on the possibilities of technological cures of disability (Allen 2013: 8-9; Cheu 2002: 199; Norden 1994: 292-295). Allen argues,

> All fiction is a product of a specific time, place, and culture that influence the way the stories are constructed and what discourses they are part of. Popular culture not only says something about the creators of fiction and their subjective world view, but its popularity also testifies to wider discourses in society today.

Any group that cannot negotiate a place for itself in the imagined future is already obsolete” (Attebery 2002: 191). To exclude, for example, people with disabilities from these futures not only reflects an imagined future but, more importantly, the reality of the present

> To constantly meet the same type of stories and stereotypes, not only in fiction but also in other parts of society, can influence one’s world view. Certain groups, in particular those already mar- ginalized in society, are constantly framed within the same type of story, which contributes to normative understandings of these groups. They are normative in the way they help sustain normative notions about groups, often by clear divisions between us/them and normal/deviant.

> Ableism according to disability scho- lar Fiona Kumari Campbell is, “[a] network of beliefs, processes and practices that produces a particular kind of self and body […] that is projected as the perfect, species-typical and therefore essential and fully human. Disability then is cast as a diminished state of being human” (qtd. in Campbell 2009: 5). Similar to racism and sexism, ableism is a discriminatory power structure that upholds able-bodi- edness/able-mindedness as superior and disability as inferior

> few has of yet explored how notions of sexuality and ability will change, and the fact that these also are categories that are culturally and historically constructed. “Critics of sf have generally agreed that science fic- tion is a ‘literature of ideas’. […] Sexuality is also an idea. […] For many people, however, sexuality – and particularly heterosexuality – can be envisioned only within the category of the ‘natural’. To these people, sexuality is quite specifically not an idea” (Pearson 2003: 149). Partly, thanks to queer theory (hetero)sexuality has increasingly been understood as an idea which is historically, culturally and socially constructed. This same notion of disability has not, as of yet, however had the same impact on society.

> Disability on the contrary has as of yet seldom been included in the notion of social equality as a way to emphasize progressive future societies. This notion of progression has an impact on the way disability has become related to the future.  From the perspective of crip temporalities, Kafer writes, “disability is seen as the sign of no future, or at least of no good future” and adds that it is assumed, “that we all agree […] that we all desire the same futures” (Kafer 2013: 3). Kafer argues that the disabled body has come to signify not having a future or that the future has faile

> With the recent cracking of genetic coding, opening up the possibility of genetic manipulation, a future where medical technology and genetic engineering will have advanced to the point where bodies can be gene- tically manipulated before birth, or treated and cured so as to make ‘di- sability’ obsolete, it is not beyond the realm of possibility. In this ‘med- ical model’, disability becomes non-existent. (Cheu 2002: 198)

> The future is extrapolated based on ableist assumptions about the connection between health, progression, and disability. Moreover, the ideal future from that perspective is undoubtedly a future where disability has been eradicated. For fic- tion narratives dealing with the future, this medical progression or regression has come to symbolize utopian/dystopian futures

> However, Star Trek: Discovery, has not only included a same-sex couple, but also characters with disabilities. While at the time of writing this only one season of Star Trek: Discovery is available, there are some indications that the creators want to problematize some previo- usly taken-for-granted notions of the future of disability.

> In addition, the Captain of the U.S.S Discovery, Captain Lorca (Jason Isaacs), is introduced as having suffered an eye injury in battle, and, though he has the medical and technological possibility to simply “have it fixed,” he has refused to do so. This refusal to make surgical corrections to his eyes can first be interpreted as an unwillingness to be “cured” and thus, choosing to live with a visual impair- ment.

Is Lorca then to be considered a character with a disa- bility only due to disabling circumstances in the prime universe, or is the visual impairments of the entire evil Terran Empire of the mirror universe to be read as a metaphor for their inability to see and value non-human species?

> charac- ters such as Alex Murphy in the RoboCop films and Darth Vader in the Star Wars films are characterized by what Martin F. Norden (1994) calls “techno-marvels”, characters that through technology been “cured” of her/his disability (Norden 1994: 292-295).6 Likewise, although not as extensive a technological alteration, Georgi La Forge (LeVar Burton) of Star Trek: The Next Generation applies tech- nology to be able to see. If instead seen from the perspective of what disability scholars have called “the social model” (see e.g. Goodley 2011: 11-13), these futu- rescapes have, in many ways, solved certain societal barriers that create and sus- tain disability. This perspective emphasizes that we are not dealing with disabled people but with disabling environments. Instead of understanding technological hybridity as a way to cure these characters, it is possible to consider a technologi- cally advanced society as a society better equipped for different kinds of bodies.
