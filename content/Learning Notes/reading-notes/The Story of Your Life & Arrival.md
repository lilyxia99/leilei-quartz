The original story is quite different from the film, as the title has already manifested. *The Story of Your Life* is more about a how the personal experience were shaped by the alien language, whereas the film, named *Arrival*, is more focused on the alien and their looming presence. The core themes of the film and the original story are very different from each other-- The story is primarily about language, human-alien relationship and emotions, while the film, although do have those elements, is a classic disaster film + thriller.

The film added A LOT more political and disastrous context--the threat of war, the pressure from the military (in the story there is some but not as much), failure of communication between the countries, world crisis... There were a lot 190 alien spots, while in the film only 12, and they occupied major geopolitical area. In the film the Heptapods say "use tool/weapon", while in the story it's just a simple sentence of "to observe". The film even added a whole new character General Shang to be the "evil China". I have to admit that the film is indeed a successful in their craft of actually telling a complete stories with all those elements, but I just find it funny that a story like this has to be adopted in such way that it doesn't escape the disaster narrative and the tropes of the hero saving the day. It couldn't be just a sweet story of a linguist, and China will always be the worst enemy of the US. 

I wonder what Ted Chiang thought of the adaptation. Although General Shang at the end did some mercy, but I am sure the depiction of China in the film would make people frown.

For heptapods, one has to know the beginning and ending state in order to initiate an action.
