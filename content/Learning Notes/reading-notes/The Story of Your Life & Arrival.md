The original story is quite different from the film, as the title has already manifested. *The Story of Your Life* is more about a how the personal experience were shaped by the alien language, whereas the film, named *Arrival*, is more focused on the alien and their looming presence. The core themes of the film and the original story are very different from each other-- The story is primarily about language, human-alien relationship and emotions, while the film, although do have those elements, is a classic disaster film + thriller.

The film added A LOT more political and disastrous context--the threat of war, the pressure from the military (in the story there is some but not as much), failure of communication between the countries, world crisis... There were a lot 190 alien spots, while in the film only 12, and they occupied major geopolitical area. In the film the Heptapods say "use tool/weapon", while in the story it's just a simple sentence of "to observe". The film even added a whole new character General Shang to be the "evil China". I have to admit that the film is indeed a successful in their craft of actually telling a complete stories with all those elements, but I just find it funny that a story like this has to be adopted in such way that it doesn't escape the disaster narrative and the tropes of the hero saving the day. It couldn't be just a sweet story of a linguist, and China will always be the worst enemy of the US. 

I wonder what Ted Chiang thought of the adaptation. Although General Shang at the end did some mercy, but I am sure the depiction of China in the film would make people frown.

# The Story of Your Life

For heptapods, one has to know the beginning and ending state in order to initiate an action. 

谈到了一些不同的语法结构，这里似乎可以回溯一下[手语的语法](https://www.sohu.com/a/325445557_100290627#google_vignette) gosh我真的太久没有复习手语了…… 

实际上这个故事，就像ted chiang那个关于按钮的故事一样，也是讨论关于自由意志的事情。但是这个事儿电影只是蜻蜓点水了一下…… 

故事的结尾其实是一种有点苦涩但是又欣然的接受。

感觉这个电影总是不可避免地变成了一种博弈

Game theory is all about communication

Alien are designed for us not to feel for them, but we kind of feel for them. They look like squid, probably because they are intelligent. 

Atmosphere in the spaceship is viscus 

Heptapod has giant

Action speech, they still need to carry it out. 

This is not time travel, this is understanding the future
