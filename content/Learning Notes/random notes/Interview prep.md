## What is your interest in teaching 

Video, Animation, Engagement. Coding, 3D. Seminar (reading club experience)

## Teaching experience

My own teaching: 
1. tried all kinds of different approach: guest artist, in class exercise, demo
2. What learnt the most is schedule management, have never manage class for a semester long
3. attendance--be strict when you need to. 以前做好学生从来没有考虑过这些问题
4. 
TA: learn how to critique, how a TA would benefit from a class. 

## Pedagogy

technique wise--自学的一些共通点。

theme wise: 1. be able to feel about an animation 2. how to tell a sincere story 

## What class I want to teach

seminar: about disability studies

fictional documentary course

Tactile device course

tutorial video course -- a blend between viralness and ponderness
