> This new arrangement of production seemed able to make any- thing out of anything, without the laborious effort of skilled handicraft. In such new systems of labor, objects were transformed rapidly before one's eyes, and the stable identity of things became as uncertain as a panoply of magician's props.

> cinema's place in a new logic of circulation had been anticipated by the commodification of still photographs, especially the postcard and the stereoscope. As Jona- than Crary has indicated, we must rethink the history of photography by not focusing solely on the mode of new technological representation that it introduced but by considering its role in "the reshaping of an entire ter- ritory on which signs and images, each effectively severed from a referent, circulate and proliferate. "4 While the debate on the ontology of the photo- graphic image has centered on the indexical tie a photograph maintains with its referent, Crary directs our attention to the actual use of photo- graphs, in which this connection to a referent interrelates with the image's detachable nature, with its ability to gain a mobility its referent never pos- sessed and to circulate separately.

> As a mode of ev- idence that cannot be denied, photography is indeed indiscreet, captur- ing information that could otherwise be hushed up or explained away.  The photograph mediates between the public and the private, attesting to an intimacy of bodies that has now become a matter of record. The only recourse Holmes and his royal client have is discovering and suppressing the photograph before it is made public.

And photography, due to its ability to link a person to certain data, becomes the tool of control.

> The nineteenth century witnessed a rearrangement of the hierarchy of ju- dicial proof, as the value previously accorded to witness testimony was re- placed by the scientific reputation of the analysis of indices. 16 As Ernst Bloch has pointed out, the sine qua non of a hunt for clues, a trial based on evidence as opposed to testimony and confession, dates only from the middle of the eighteenth century. 17 This new concept of evidence trans- formed both the narrative logic of signs of guilt and the methods of recog- nition. Instead of reading conventional signs imprinted on the criminal body with the force of sovereign power, detection was approached as a science, employing careful measurement and observation, privileging re- gimes of knowledge over brute force.

> Detection follows a fading trail of cause and effect rather than exposing an indelible mark.  While such signs are more circumstantial and less overtly visible, they may also betray a man without his knowing it. The modern detective thus finds his or her model in Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, who, as the semioti- cian Thomas Sebeok has emphasized, founded his method upon "the ob- servation of trifles." 19

> The role of the modern de- tective did not correspond to the earlier "physiologies" which subsumed criminals under ideal physical types. Identification, rather, relied on the absolute and ineradicable individuality (and unique culpability) of a spe- cific criminal. As Gallus Muller, an American proponent of Alphonse Ber- tillon's method for identifying criminals, stated, the goal of such identifi- cation was "to fix the human personality, to give each human being an identity, an individuality, certain, durable, invariable, always recognizable, and always capable of being proven." 22

> the photographic image contributes to the very constitution of such identity as social identity and therefore participates in the emergence of the individual in the modern sense of the term." 23 Such techniques of identification became necessary in the new world of rapid circulation and facilitated the circulation of the newly constituted individual through its circuits with a traceable accountability.

> The criminal can use disguise and alias to elude recognition. However, the detective can iden- tify the criminal precisely by focusing on marks that the criminal might not be aware of or would find difficult or impossible to conceal. The drama of this new form of evidence lies less in stripping the criminal of his dis- guise (like the chief of the Surete who knocks off Vautrin's wig and reveals his shock of red hair in Balzac's Pere Goriot) than in capturing the criminal in an act of unconscious revelation.

> The body has become a sort of unwilled speech, an utterance whose code is in the possession of a figure of authority rather than controlled by its enunciator. Although the criminal may assume an alias or seek to camouflage his or her iden- tity through changing hair color or through other disguises, the specialist guided by the Bertillon code sees through this false body language and uncovers an indelible identity residing in a fixed arrangement of bodily elements.

> Systems of classification made the photograph responsive within this modern method of identification, marking each body through a regulated process of classification so thorough that Bertillon even downplayed the necessity of photography to the process. 44 However, the indexical nature of the photograph, its role in actually connecting an individual to his or her own image, still underpinned the whole system.
