I am Leilei, and I am an tactile artist and filmmaker. This is [my blog](https://www.leileixia.online), I kind of just [[Why I write my post|like writing something to an anonymous public]] . I put my reading notes and zettlekasten here, and if you are interested in my artworks, you can visit [my website](https://www.leileixia.com)

You can find the [[Index_of_content|index ]] here or on the explorer on the left or the bottom (if your window is small or mobile) For screenreaders the index page is probably easier


[[All Dairies|Some of my diaries ]] I write my Dairies everyday

[[Leilei's Collections]] Where I put some references, artist I have looked at or want to look at, or books I have briefly read or wanted to read

My Reading notes #reading-notes

My tech notes #tech-notes

Or check out the [[Learning Notes Index]] reading reviews or technique notes.
