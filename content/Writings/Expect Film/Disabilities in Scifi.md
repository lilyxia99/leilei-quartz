## Abstract

"Expect'' is a speculative sci-fi documentary shot in Virtual Reality (VR) that explores the hidden details behind how disabilities are represented in science fiction literature and media. The work features Chinese actors with disabilities role-playing as sci-fi characters in VR to rewrite, challenge and reimagine the conventional, ableist sci-fi tropes, such as “super-crip” and the tendency to “fix” or eradicate disabilities through the myth of enhancement. It brings focus to a larger social fabric of bio-power, labor, technology, and their interplay in the Chinese ideological environment. The accessibility of spectatorship is self-reflexively manifested inside and outside the film. “Expect” includes the process of actors with different disabilities interacting with the inaccessible VR device, and the film juxtaposes dialogues, meta-narrations and actors’ real-story interviews to further break the fourth walls in a Brechetian style. The VR filmmaking process reveals the fake promise of immersiveness, media augmentation and accessibility, which becomes the best commentary on how disabilities were instrumentalized yet never really been respected in a futuristic discussion.

## Background

### Disability in Real Life


The definition of disability has always been changing along with the evolution of social value and contexts. The three most classic ways to understand disabilities are moral models, medical models and social models.

#### Different Individual Models

 Although usually we would talk about moral models and medical models as individual models, in our discussion I would like to see them under the same category. Both of them view disability based on personal physiological traits, and these notion also lead to the tropes in science fiction that we will talk about later. 
##### Moral Model

The moral model of disability views disability as a reflection of an individual's or family's character, deeds, thoughts, and karma, leading to either stigma and shame or being seen as a mark of honor and strength. In ancient China, for example, although there was notion to support and care about people with disabilities in classical Chinese philosophy, in rural area disability is often seen as a punishment or a test of faith which requires moral correction or spiritual healing rather than medical treatment or social accommodation, especially under the influence of Buddism and its idea of Karma[[Disabilities in Scifi#^d47931|(Ghose, 2007).]]  This model is often utilized in media in which characters with disabilities either are evil due to their miserable life caused by their body and marginalized situation, or become what we call “super-crip”, who becomes the inspirational symbol simply because they overcome the barriers that were imposed by the normative environment; the Chinese phrase word "身残志坚"(strong spirit despite weak body) represent this common media representation of Disability. The individual is expected to overcome all the barriers on their own or their family instead of complaining about the environment. (Yang, 2015, summarizing Oliver, 1983, 1990；Finkelstein, 1993)  

##### Medical Model

In 1980, disabilities are categorized under disease by WHO in _International Classification of Functions, Disabilities and Health_, paving the foundation for medical model. The medical model of disability emerged as societies started to view disability more as a matter of health and biology rather than moral failing. It focuses on the individual's impairment or difference, treating disability as a problem that resides within the person. According to the medical model, the primary response to disability is treatment or cure through medical intervention. This model seeks to "fix" the disability through surgery, medication, or rehabilitation, with the goal of bringing the individual's physical or mental condition as close to the norm as possible. (Yang, 2015 ) While the medical model has contributed significantly to advancements in treatment and accessibility, it has also been criticized for overlooking the social and environmental barriers faced by people with disabilities.

Medical model is still widely used among different countries. While it is a little more benevolent than individual model, it still didn't escape the mindset of regarding disability as casued by someone's own physical traits. Mike Oliver in *The Individual And Social Models of Disability* explained the distinction between illness and disabilities, and the key problem in medical model: 

>Some illnesses may have disabling consequences and many disabled people have illnesses at various points in their lives......doctors can have a role to play in the lives of disabled people......The problem arises when doctors try to use their knowledge and skills to treat disability rather than illness......[and]The whole medical and rehabilitation enterprise is founded upon an ideology of normality. It's aim is to restore the disabled person to normality, whatever that may mean.......whatever its costs in terms of the pain and suffering of disabled individuals, is always justified and justifiable -the ideology of normality rules. 

#### Social Model

While medical models was established, a lot of social movement also were happening during the same time. Organizations like International Disability Alliance and the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation resisted the institutionalization and isolation of people with disabilities, and insisted the society to take up responsibility to eradicate barriers. In 2001, _International Classification of Functions，Disabilities and Health_ was published by WHO, (Yang, 2015) which formally recognized health not only on a personal level, but also on a social level. barriers are not only caused by impairment of a body, but also caused by different relative environment. A marked ground could be barrier for wheelchair user, but might be convenient for visually impaired person to figure out the road. (WHO, 2001) If the facilities in a society is good enough, and if opportunities for people with disability to participate social life is adequate enough, the barrier will ceased to exist. Only when a wheelchair user is refused by the school because there is too much stairs, when a deaf worker is refused by a company because of lack of support and patience, would disability arises as into a cage and label that press on an individual. 

### Disability in Science Fiction

Fictions are mirror of our public consciousness. While I don't think the settings and characters of an individual novel necessary reflect the author's moral values, I do think that popular trends and common tropes in works reveal the common subconscious choices that originated from our shared belief, and the story in return shape, reinforce or subvert the reader's norms. The starting point of this project is from the observation of popular science fiction from in which the mindsets in reality are represented. I would briefly talk about what kind of science fiction works I am referring to in this project, how they are related to the different models we have discussed, and how it leads to the artistic research in the next chapter. 

#### Science Fiction and  Futurescapes

From *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea* to *Matrix* (the Wachowskis, 1999), sci-fi works dedicate themselves to think about how should human understand themselves and one another by the imagining alternative living conditions, some of them are almost equivalent to philosophical thought experiments. Sci-fi is definitely not limited to presenting what is mentioned above. A big part of the sci-fi works are disaster films like *2012* (Roland Emmerich, 2009) and *Wandering Earth*(Guo Fan, 2019) which showcase how future situation leads to big human crisis, political fantasy that involves modern technology like *1984* (George Orwell, 1984), more intimate approach like *The Story Of Your Life* (Ted Chiang, 1998) that explore more niche aspect of human technology interaction or Niche *Journey to the west*. 

The definition of Sci-fi in this paper will focus more on the sci-fi works that reveal the picture of a society or a portrait of a person living in a society under the development of technology or ideology, in another word, Futurescapes. Works like *Brave New World*, *Star Wars*, *Neuromancer* and  *Pantheon* would fall into that category. These type of works are also the one of the most popular types of science fiction works, which means they not only reflect a normally accepted belief or concern about technology, but also that inappropriate portrayal of people in minority groups-- people of color, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ communities--in such works will put these group in danger of being reduced to symbols and instruments of narratives and further inflicted into stereotype. 

#### Tropes of Characters with disability in Science Fiction

Disability appears very common in Literature, though usually as a device instead of main theme. In *Narrative prosthesis: disability and the dependencies of discourse*, David T. Mitchell and Sharon L. Snyder explained:

>The perception of a “crisis” or a “special situation” has made disabled people the subject of not only governmental policies and social programs but also a primary object of literary representation......their function in literary discourse is primarily twofold: disability pervades literary narrative, first, as a stock feature of characterization and, second, as an opportunistic metaphorical device......while stories rely upon the potency of disability as a symbolic figure, they rarely take up disability as an experience of social or political dimensions. (Mitchell and Snyder, 2001, p. 47)

This passage concludes the common situation of disability in a story. For protagonist, a story might very likely starts with a character having disability, and either their whole motivation to proceed the adventure is to being fixed, or they are fixed right at the beginning. For villain, disability is the symbol of miserable life and the primary trauma that puts them into the dark path. For side character, disability is used to prove their perseverance, sacredness and innocence, or to set off another character's innocence. All these tropes reveal how the narrative treats disability under individual models: If you are a good character, you need to be fixed because disability is disease, or at least you should hold high morality to support a "despite that they are cripped..." narrative, and if you can't be a good character, under a moral model, you are bad exactly because you are disabled, because you are monster.

I will use *Full-metal Alchemist* as an example, because I personally love *Full-Metal Alchemist* so much that when I read the about the Narrative Prothesis, the first work I thought of is this piece. It's not really a sci-fi as the background is a little steampunk and fantasy, but the way alchemy is used in the story is very much similar to that of technology. Protagonist Edward Erlic lost his arm and legs after a human revival alchemy ritual, and while he got equipped with Automails afterwards, which are Metal Prothesis that enabled him to be as agile as any other fighters, he still persist on finding his lost body and took on the journey. When he hadn't got Automails, he was depressed and couldn't set off for anything. As soon as he recollected his hope, he requested for Automails. This dichotomy of "cured and hopeful" vs "not cured and miserable" happens several times in the story. 

The stereotype of the mutilated avengers (Mitchell and Snyder, 2001, p. 97) also exist in the story: The character Scar, who was one of the villains in the first half part of the stories (although more like frenemy), also experienced injury which took away his right arm. Although his arm was replaced by the one of his brother's, his cruelty in killing and destroying still originates from that trauma. 

#### Transhumanism and Technological Cure

There are many directions to critique about the represnetaions of disabilities, and what I am particularly interested is the idea of "technological cure": for Edward Erlic it's Automails and philosopher's stone, for Luke Skywalker in *Star Wars* it's the cybernetic limb, and for Motoko Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell it's her whole body. Although this is the almost most classic way to imagine human future, we rarely think of these characters as disabled, because as soon as their disabilities emerges, it is erased by the technology and the body is fixed back to the normal, sometimes even powerful than human. The disability is only used as the pathway to level up, a transient status, a "used to be", instead of an actual state that's worth being discussed. Such tropes reflect a medical model of thinking. prothesis are presented as the panacea to turn a deformed body back to a homogenous standard, while the danger and risk that accompanies the technology are often ignored and overlooked in the stories. That's why in *Cyberpunk 2077*, changing limbs and arms are as easy as changing clothes, but nobody cares about whether they need to be charged.

Such a technological cure is closely related to a philosophical and social movement called transhumanism. According to Nick Bostrom, one of the authors of *The Transhumanist Declaration* 

>Transhumanism ...... holds that current human nature is improvable through the use of applied science and other rational methods, which may make it possible to increase human health-span, extend our intellectual and physical capacities, and give us increased control over our own mental states and moods. Technologies of concern include not only current ones, like genetic engineering and information technology, but also anticipated future developments such as fully immersive virtual reality, machinephase nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence

It's worth noting that transhumanism is not equivalent with posthumanism which strive to move away from an anthropocentric view by embracing the implication of technology. Transhumanism and posthuman are actually quite different. The former is a extreme pursue of highly centralized and homogenous view of a "better future", when the other embraces different creatures and races, diversity, and de-centered narratives. When Donna Haraway talked about cyborgs and posthuman, she was calling for a more diverse society where people can all be living in different ways. From transhumanist view, however, there is a standardized trajectory of "evolution": stronger, smarter, and live longer. A good transhumanist future is where individuals modify themselves to fit the fast pace and high standards of society. What a good society is not one in which all the different people can have their own way, but one in which all people move efficiently on a similar channels. 

The presence of disability is often used as a sign of a failed future.” (Wälivaara, 2018, p. 226) Eugenics

中国语境很符合超人类主义
In China, according Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of Persons with Disabilities, “a person with a disability is a person who, psychologically, physiologically…has suffered a loss or abnormality… and has lost … the ability to engage in certain activities in a normal manner.” The definition is focused more on a person’s instability to fit the “normal” life (usually production life) in with the “normal” manner, without a clear definition of what normal means. 

#### An Alternative Future of Anti-Cure

+ What is Anti-Cure
+ how an Anti-Cure and accessible future be
+ An accessible future doesn't need that advance technology. Ideology is also a technology.

### The Question of Omniscient Perspective

Although I read these theories of disability studies and understood the claims of anti-cure, a strange feeling always floated in my mind -- Is it really so easy to achieve the accessible world? What's really stopping us? As an non-disabled artist, I can't imagine how it really is to be a person with disabilities, but if I did have temporary paralyzing experience of breaking my back and couldn't get up from the bed, during which I don't know how soon or whether I could recover. The thought that flashed through my mind at that time was that I would really like some technology that would allow me to get off the ground and run again. 

Even though I knew what the more progressive and righteous perspective should be, when it comes down to it, it's hard for to resist the temptation to be cured by technology. One time I listened to a panel about birth control and disability, while most of the expert there were talking about the anti-eugenics, which I totally agree. Later when it comes to a guest of an ordinary woman with disabilities, she told her story, and just directly express her gratitude that her child is healthy and normal. It was actually a little awkward: on one hand for the fight of disabilities right, we need to oppose the idea of eugenics, but on the other hand, it's such a natural thought to want your child to be healthy, especially when family would have to afford all the expenses caused by social barriers. I know it's not the "right" way to think, but I couldn't blame that mother. Who has the right to force her to undertake all the burden of ideological progress? The life of a human being is too short to expect the social change, and not everyone is ready to fight against it, especially when one understand the stubbornness of the norm. It's easy to imagine for an era from an omniscient perspective, but hard to carry it out as a person. 

The question of the omniscient perspective also happens on the research level. If the current depiction of characters with disabilities and futurescape is not being responsible enough, then what would be a good way to create those movies and novels? I again couldn't help imagining myself being the author -- can't write a disabled villain because that's stereotype, can't write a disabled good person because that's super-crip, can't write a normal disabled person because that's ignoring the issue of disabilities; and, after all, how big a responsibility does a writer have to write appropriately, while it's just one novel? The micro versus macro conflict in fiction is just as confusing as the one in reality. I am not sure. I need to find out. 

## Embodied Exploration: *Expect* 

In *Lost Race of Science Fiction*(1980), Octavia Butler writes:

>what do authors ordinarily do when they decide to write about an unfamiliar subject? They research. They read—in this case recent biographies and autobiographies of people in the group they want to write about are good. They talk to members of that group—friends, acquaintances, coworkers, fellow students, even strangers on buses or waiting in lines. 

They research, read and talk, and afterwards, they need to write. As a filmmaker, how do I achieve all of those things together? 

### Form: Half Documentary Half Fiction

The first way I think of is to make a documentary. The question I was having all comes thinking from the perspective of people with disability and ask how they feel and how would they choose. *Fixed: The Science/Fiction of Human Enhancement* is a great example that covers all the basic conflict point around the debate of transhumanism, in which opinions from scholars, ordinary people, engineers and many other stakeholders form a spectrum of discussion over this topic. 

What I am interested, however, is not only the discussion of reality. What I am interested is the real tendency that's being reflected in the context of science fiction. There is a Chinese saying of "纸上得来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行"（Paper knowledge is shallow, real understanding comes from personal experience.) Instead of simply asking about their opinion on existing science fiction work, why not throw ourselves into those world? It's probably when one really becomes an individual in those futurescape that they would find out what's really at stake to live in this world. 

I decided on the having the film be presented as half fiction half documentary: sometimes we chat about real life, and sometimes we made up things, and in the film, the two are not strictly distinguished, so that the audience can't tell the truth from the false. Following these purpose, I used role-playing and other strategies which are introduced in the following section to conduct the research. 

It's worth mentioning that I also decided to keep the realm of the project within China. As a Chinese artist, I am particularly interested in disability in the Chinese context. In China, disability study is not yet an official discipline, nor is there enough discussion on equal rights for disability which are sometimes even politically sensitive. At the same time, there's a strange tendency toward transhumanism in the values of Chinese society today as I have mentioned before. While the question in Chinese context is fascinating, I am also more familiar with the disabilities community in China, as I had worked with different communities of disabilities and learned disability studies through Chinese grassroots organizations; in my professional practice, I have a long-time working relationship with Chinese disabled artists(who will also participate in this project) and have a follower community of disabilities. I wanted to have deeper conversations with them on how they see ableism permeating in China, and if there is a way out.

### Strategy: Story As Both Noun and Verb

#### Role Playing and Acting

A Role-Playing Game(RPG), is a genre of game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. When I was playing some TRPG game(Tabletop Role-Playing Game, in Chinese we call it "跑团", which means "run the group"), I feel like I was writing a novel along with other player. While still very much being myself, I am indeed acting another character, and will not think out of character (OOC). I see the potential of using this framework to both talk about problems in real life and explore science fiction imagination. 

I asked people with disabilities who are interested in science fiction to imagine themselves as a member of a science fiction work or a future, alien, alternative civilization. I act as a traveller who accidentally came into their, and they would take me around their world and answer various questions of mine. 

I first asked some of my friends who fit the criteria, and then sent out an open call to the WeChat group of disabilities communities, and soon I got several responses, from which I did the interview, and selected 3 people plus 3 of my friends in the end, all of whom are from China. The way I filter them is based quite subjective: simply based on whether I feel they are interesting and in the play while doing Role-Playing with me. 

The reason why I have this "interview" process is because I am not simply looking for documentary subject --  I am recruiting actors. I regard the participants of this project as what I call "interview-actor". While most of what we discussed was based on their story, which stemmed from their own lives, they retain the right to fictionalize the truth; On the other hand, I do have requirement on them as actors, as they need to dedicate enough shooting time with me, be able to jump into the story whenever we start, and stay within the character during the acting.

Another reason why I want to recruit them as actors is because I’ve seen a lot of other projects that claim themselves to be “co-creation”, but ended up as just exploiting the time and labor of people with disabilities for free. In this project, actors are also paid for their acting, time and effort. They contribute to the script, set design and their costume design. 
#### VR

 When I am talking about sets and costumes, however, I am actually referring to 3D worlds and avatars. This is because our Role-Playing didn't happen in real life, but in Virtual Reality(VR). We use VRChat as the platform for immersive environment, so that the actors in China can be in a same space with me and my cinematographer in the US. 
 
 Interviews in reality and interviews in virtual reality have their pros and cons, and their focuses are different. If I were making a documentary in reality, I would probably go and stay at their home for a few days, meet them on several trips, film them with a camera, and even spy on their every gesture. I would want to get as much footage as possible in order to present their kernel of personality, rather than a performance for the camera. Virtual filmmaking, especially in this film, emphasize acting and non-realism in the first place. It refuses to present everything as it is and nullifies the expectation of realism or truth-seeking in conventional documentary context. The world, houses and even their own appearance are all virtual assets that are by no means realistic, but since they are designed and selected based on their imagination, they do reflect their personal preferences and values, just like how we see real life from science fictions. 

Although shot in VR, the final product is a single channel film piece. 

To some degrees, VR itself also a very "sci-fi-ish" technology. While constantly being depicted as the ultimate technology for entertainment, education, and even escaping the limitations of the physical world, the technical limitations, high costs, and a lack of widespread content makes it a perpetually unfulfilled promise. During our shooting process, we also encounter many barriers: The inaccessible design of VR headset, the constant bugs of device that arise out of nowhere and the Internet firewalls between China and US. All those process becomes the best real life echo of how technology, while providing certain access, creates even more barriers and difficulties, and often doesn't take the need from people with disabilities into account. While the device reflects the failure of technology, the virtual set up for VR also reflects the lack of consideration for disabilities. There is no existing instruction on how to design a wheelchair chair character, and I have to figure out a work around which is imperfect in fitting with the the VRChat system. The process and tutorial for how to create an accessible VR environment are included in the film, pointing back to the concept the mixing of fiction and reality.

#### Invisible Object

Although the VR world theoretically can contain endless objects, due to the improvisation nature, not every needed props could be prepared. To resolve this,  we used a technique called “invisible object”, which is essentially miming. We mimic the gesture of touching an object, and by doing so we feel the object even without the actual physical object. This method enable us to “create” objects when there were limited assets and interaction in the game, and by echoing and responding to each other’s performance. I have used this methods in my previous work *Palace* and *Empty Touch Workshop*, and while in previous cases we were touching things with out eyes closed, this time I added a step to open our eyes and mimic sound effects while doing the gesturing. The methods not only help the actors enter their acting state more quickly, but also thematically fits the setting that every world and stories in this film are made up out of thin air. This materialless performance bridges the performers who are in different places; it is both an exercise in acting and the building of a tacit understanding. We work in tandem to accomplish a non-verbal communication, like children playing house, stepping into the fantasy of mutual recognition.

### The Ambivalent Individual

#### About Stories

发现2： 每个人的性格以及他们的背景，都和他们的故事本身一样很有趣。了解他们这些人的性格才能理解他们为什么会想到这样的故事。

科幻故事总是和世界观有关，总是和很大的概念和创意有关。但是我似乎更加关心个人。到底怎样才是好的科幻呢？我也不指导。
关于这些个人的描写，能够如何改变科幻的范式呢？怎样去书写一个残障的角色才是妥帖的，才不会沦为一种符号和工具呢？或许就是通过一个立体的角色的呈现吧。者无关主义，无关政治正确，而是关于角色本身是否鲜活，其实是关于是否是一个好作品。

#### About Life

发现1：残障人本身自然是有不同的看法。有的人会更有自己的身份认同，有的人会希望“光荣的进化”。两边都有一点理想主义的感觉，而且我与两边都能共情。面对那种“真诚的健全主义”期待，有一种秀才遇上兵，有理说不清的感觉。似乎每一个人都太不一样了，很难从一个自上而下的视角上去要求谁。

即便我心里知道所谓更加“progressive”的想法的时候，作为个人，很难不期盼某种光荣的进化。这种时候一个人应该被教育，你就应该安分守己，安于自己的现状吗？
“作为个人，我们如何contribute to到达这个未来的路”
