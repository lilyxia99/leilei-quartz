## Disability in Science Fiction

While this is not a literature analysis piece, the starting point of this piece is from the observation of popular science fiction, and the question that's being explored is embedded in the context of the current insufficient and problematic portray of disability in those narrative. Therefore, I would briefly talk about what kind of science fiction works I am referring to in this project, what are their problems, and how it leads to the artistic research in the next chapter. 

### Science Fiction and  Futurescapes

Science fiction, often abbreviated as sci-fi, is a genre of literature, film, and other forms of media that explores imaginative and speculative concepts that are grounded in scientific or technological advances and discoveries, as well as their potential impact on society, individuals, or the universe. From *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea* to *Matrix*, sci-fi works dedicate themselves to think about how should human understand themselves and one another by the imagining alternative living conditions, some of them are almost equivalent to philosophical thought experiments.  

Sci-fi, however, is definitely not limited to presenting what is mentioned above. A big part of the sci-fi works are disaster films like *2012* or *Wandering Earth* in which the disaster that will kill the entire species originates from some future problem. Others might be also showcasing terrible future, but more like political fantasy that involves modern technology, like *1984*. Some sci-fi works, Ted-Chiang's *The Story Of Your Life*, for example, enter more intimate perspective to explore how an individual's experience would be changed by alien languages, virtual pets, prediction machines, etc. There are many other mix-genre representatives as well, such as the combination of horror and sci-fi in *Nope* and the mixture of moku-mentary and sci-fi in *Journey to the west*. 

The definition of Sci-fi in this paper will focus more on the sci-fi works that reveal the picture of a society or a portrait of a person living in a society under the development of technology or ideology, in another word, Futurescapes. Works like *Brave New World*, *Star Wars*, *Neuromancer* and  *Pantheon* would fall into that category. In these works, what satisfies and resonate the author and the readers is actually the display of our current ideology or the value judgement, although mediated through a fictional universe or time era. These type of works are also the one of the most popular types of science fiction works, which means they not only reflect a normally accepted belief or concern about technology, but also that inappropriate portrayal of people in minority groups-- people of color, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ communities--in such works will put these group in danger of being reduced to symbols and instruments of narratives and further inflicted into stereotype. 

### Tropes of Characters with disability in Science Fiction

Disability appears very common in Literature, though usually as a device instead of main theme. In *Narrative prosthesis: disability and the dependencies of discourse*, David T. Mitchell and Sharon L. Snyder explained:

>The perception of a “crisis” or a “special situation” has made disabled people the subject of not only governmental policies and social programs but also a primary object of literary representation......their function in literary discourse is primarily twofold: disability pervades literary narrative, first, as a stock feature of characterization and, second, as an opportunistic metaphorical device......while stories rely upon the potency of disability as a symbolic figure, they rarely take up disability as an experience of social or political dimensions. (Mitchell and Snyder, 2001, p. 47)

This passage concludes the common situation of disability in a story. For protagonist, a story might very likely starts with a character having disability, and either their whole motivation to proceed the adventure is to being fixed, or they are fixed right at the beginning, or both. For villain, disability is the symbol of miserable life and the primary trauma that puts them into the dark path. For side character, disability is used to prove their perseverance, sacredness and innocence, or to set off another character's innocence.  

I will use *Full-metal Alchemist* as an example, because I personally love *Full-Metal Alchemist* so much that when I read the about the Narrative Prothesis, the first work I thought of is this piece. It's appears not really a sci-fi as the background is a little steampunk and fantasy, but the way alchemy is used in the story is very much similar to that of technology. Protagonist Edward Erlic lost his arm and legs after a human revival alchemy ritual, and while he got equipped with Automails afterwards, which are Metal Prothesis that enabled him to be as agile as any other fighters, he still persist on finding his lost body and took on the journey. When he hadn't got Automails, he was depressed and couldn't set off for anything. As soon as he recollected his hope, he requested for Automails. This dichotomy of "cured and hopeful" vs "not cured and miserable" happens several times in the story. The stereotype of the mutilated avengers (Mitchell and Snyder, 2001, p. 97) also exist in the story: The character Scar, who was one of the villains in the first half part of the stories (although more like frenemy), also experienced injury which took away his right arm. Although he didn't turn one-armed because his arm was replaced by the one of his brother's, he cruelty in killing and destroying still originates from that trauma. 

While these are all interesting aspect to discuss, I am particularly interested in the idea of "technological cure" for disability, just like how Edward Erlic is "cured" by Automails. This is the most classic way to imagine human future. There are countless examples in science fiction like Luke Skywalker in *Star Wars*, Winter Soldier in *Captain America*, Major Motoko Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell, and so on. We rarely think of them as disabilities, however, because as soon as their disabilities emerges, they are immediately "cured" by the technology and fixed back to the normal state, and sometimes even more becomes super human. Such narrative convention reflects our eagerness to annihilate disability as soon as possible instead of accommodating or including it as part of our society, because disability is only used as the pathway to level up, a transient status, a "used to be", instead of an actual state that's worth being discussed. 

While enhancement is a tempting possibility, such a homogenous way to imagine the future of disability is inherently implementing a medical model of thinking that regards disability as impairment and pathological condition. (Wälivaara, 2018, p. 229) Prothesis are presented as the panacea to turn a deformed body back to a homogenous standard, and the danger and risk that accompanies the technology are often ignored and overlooked in the stories. 

When Donna Haraway talked about cyborgs, she was calling for a more diverse society where people can all be living in different ways. Now, however, technology  a good society is where individuals should modify themselves in order to fit the fast pace and high standards of society. What a good society is not one in which all the different people can have their own way, but one in which all people move "efficiently" on similar channels.  

As Josefine Wälivaara said: "portrayals of homo/bisexuality and disability has been used as narrative devices to emphasis 'good' or 'bad' futures...disability, partly due to the perseverance of a medical understanding of disability, instead is used as a sign of a failed future.” ([Josefine Wälivaara, 2018, p. 226](zotero://select/library/items/HTKFAMBB))


## Transhumanism VS Anti-Cure

## Terminology

### Interview-Actor

~~在这篇文章中，我会使用 interview-actor 这样一个我自造的词。因为参与这个项目的人并不完全是纪录片中的受访者，也不全是演员。我们讨论的事情很大部分是基于他们的讲述，which stemmed from their own lives. 但与此同时，他们保留了在讲述中虚构的权利；我们在聊天的时候有时候会真实地聊天，有时候在一本正经地胡说八道，但是在影片中这两者并没有被严格的区别开，以至于观众无法分清真假。

In this article, I will use a made-up word called interview-actor, because the people involved in this project are not exactly the interviewees in a documentary, nor are they entirely actors. While most of what we discussed was based on their story, which stemmed from their own lives, they retain the right to fictionalize the truth; sometimes we chat about real life, and sometimes we made up things, and in the film, the two are not strictly distinguished, so that the audience can't tell the truth from the false.

### VR and VRChat

As mentioned in the beginning, VR stands for Virtual Reality. 

### RPG

An RPG, or Role-Playing Game, is a genre of game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. RPG can be divided into many sub-categories like ERPG(Electronic Role-Playing Game), TRPG(Tabletop Role-Playing Game), VTRPG (Virtual Tabletop Role-Playing Game) and LARP ( Live Action Role-Playing). The acting process in this film is similar to a VTRPG: we meet each other virtually through VRChat, and interview-actors need to act out their roles within a narrative through dialogue or narrating actions, just like how players in TRPG do. It’s a different from traditional TRPG that is not win or lose in this process, nor are we using strict character building system or any maps to chart our progress. It’s not a classic “The Hero’s Journey”, but rather “A Hero’s Day”.  

### Invisible Object and Empty Touch

In the film we will use a technique called “invisible object”, which comes from a workshop that I developed. We mimic the gesture of touching an object, and by doing so we feel the object even without the actual physical object. This method enable us to “create” objects when there were limited assets and interaction in the game, and by echoing and responding to each other’s performance, 这种无实物表演衔接了身处异地的表演者；它既是一种演技的练习，也是一种默契的建立。我们配合中完成一种非语言的交流，像玩过家家的小孩子一样，踏入共同确认的幻想中。

invisible object同时也对应了这部影片半虚构半纪录的本质。在虚构的层面上，电影中每一个世界观和故事都是凭空虚构的。演绎的目的不是为了去除反而是突出这种幻想性，同时角色扮演本身就需要一种虚空中来的信念感，正如小说家创作他们作品时候需要的那样，


## 赛博朋克世界

虽然读了这些残障研究的理论，明白了anti-cure的主张，但是一种异样的感觉总是浮在我的心头——理论真的能那么容易地付诸实践吗？这种疑问在我带着各种残障理论知识去做采访的时候逐渐浮现出来，尤其是当我采访赛博朋克主题的这几位 interview-actors 的时候。

Although I read these theories of disability studies and understood the claims of anti-cure, a strange feeling always floated in my mind -- can these theories really carried out that easily? This question gradually surfaced when I took my knowledge of various disability theories to do interviews, especially when I interviewed these interview-actors of the cyberpunk theme.

有趣的是，虽然我采访的对象不多，但是几乎所有受访的男性都想象了一种赛博朋克感十足的世界，尤其是要含有身体改造的元素。

作为一个健全人，我没办法想象真正作为残障人会是怎样的生活，但是我曾经也面临过卧床不起的情况，那个时候闪过我脑海的念头就是我渴望那样的科技可以让我再下地去跑步。即便我知道更有残障权益视角的想法应该怎样，更加先进的理念是怎样，但是事情摊在自己的头上，一个人是会很难拒绝被科技治愈的诱惑的。
