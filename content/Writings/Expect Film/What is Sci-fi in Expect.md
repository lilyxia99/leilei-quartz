Science fiction, often abbreviated as sci-fi, is a genre of literature, film, and other forms of media that explores imaginative and speculative concepts that are grounded in scientific or technological advances and discoveries, as well as their potential impact on society, individuals, or the universe. From *Brave New World* to *Matrix*, sci-fi works dedicate themselves to think about how should human understand themselves and one another by the imagining alternative living conditions, some of them are almost equivalent to philosophical thought experiments.  

Sci-fi, however, is definitely not limited to presenting what is mentioned above. A big part of the sci-fi works are disaster films like *2012* or *Wandering Earth* in which the disaster that will kill the entire species originates from some future problem. Some sci-fi works like Ted-Chiang's *The Story Of Your Life* takes an alternative micro and more personal view of how language change an individuals mind without mentioning too much about the traditional future imagination or disaster of a society. There are many other mix-genre representatives as well, such as the combination of horror and sci-fi in *Nope* and the mixture of mokumentary and sci-fi in *Journey to the west*.
