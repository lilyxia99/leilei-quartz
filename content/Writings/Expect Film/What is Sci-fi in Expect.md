### Futurescape

Science fiction, often abbreviated as sci-fi, is a genre of literature, film, and other forms of media that explores imaginative and speculative concepts that are grounded in scientific or technological advances and discoveries, as well as their potential impact on society, individuals, or the universe. From *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea* to *Matrix*, sci-fi works dedicate themselves to think about how should human understand themselves and one another by the imagining alternative living conditions, some of them are almost equivalent to philosophical thought experiments.  

Sci-fi, however, is definitely not limited to presenting what is mentioned above. A big part of the sci-fi works are disaster films like *2012* or *Wandering Earth* in which the disaster that will kill the entire species originates from some future problem. Others might be also showcasing terrible future, but more like political fantasy that involves modern technology, like *1984*. Some sci-fi works, Ted-Chiang's *The Story Of Your Life*, for example, enter more intimate perspective to explore how an individual's experience would be changed by alien languages, virtual pets, prediction machines, etc. There are many other mix-genre representatives as well, such as the combination of horror and sci-fi in *Nope* and the mixture of mokumentary and sci-fi in *Journey to the west*. 

The definition of Sci-fi in this paper will focus more on the sci-fi works that reveal the picture of a society or a portrait of a person living in a society under the development of technology or ideology, in another word, Futurescape. Works like *Brave New World*, *Star Wars*, *Neuromancer* and  *Pantheon* would fall into that category. In these works, what satisfies and resonate the author and the readers is actually the display of our current ideology or the value judgement, although mediated through a fictional universe or time era. These type of works are also the one of the most popular types of science fiction works, which means they not only reflect a normally accepted belief or concern about technology, but also that inappropriate portrayal of people in minority groups-- people of color, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ communities--in such works will put these group in danger of being reduced to symbols and instruments of narratives and further inflicted into stereotype.
