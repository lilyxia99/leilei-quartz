>Transhumanist promote the investment of time and research into technology to improve cognition, anti-aging techniques, reproductive technology, and life suspension techniques such as cryogenics...in order to understand both their risks and possibilities. Ultimately, what individuals stand to gain, according to transhumanists, is the “use of technology to extend their mental and physical (including reproductive) capacities and to improve their control over their own lives” (Bostrom 2005b, Appendix). 

In short, transhumanism aims at using science and technology to make humans stronger, smarter, and healthier, and even help us live much longer than we do now. It's like an Olympics of human life. 

Transhumanism representations are very common in a lot of the sci-fi works, such as *Ghost In the Shell*, *Pantheon*, *Altered Carbon*, and so on. especially with cyborg narratie, and while some are fully embracing such enhancement, a lot of the also explore the ethics and risk that involves with it.
